title=New poll, new features
text=We have a new poll finally: How often should Boson be released?<br>
    The previous poll was up more than 6 weeks (for too long, I know) and had
    more than 120 votes. Quite expectedly, people want AI most, more than half
    of the voters chose AI. Second place went to better graphics.<br><br>
    About AI, unfortunately we won't have any intelligent AI in 0.9 (it will
    still have same dummy AI that 0.8 had), but there is already scripting
    support and once it has evolved far enough, we'll start developing AI. So,
    there is possibility that 0.10 (that's right, after 0.9 will come 0.10, not
    1.0) will have AI.<br>
    We'll use <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> as scripting language,
    so in case you have any experience with either this or AI and if you're
    willing to help us, write to our
    <a href="mailto:boson-devel@__NOSPAM__lists.sourceforge.net">mailing
    list.</a><br>
    About graphics, if you're an artist, please
    <a href="mailto:boson-devel@__NOSPAM__lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a>!
    We need your help! Programmers and testers are welcome too!<br><br>
    On other news, CVS has some new new features again.<br>
    Probably most noticeable is improved support for lighting, e.g. terrain is
    now lit correctly. Models have support for smooth surfaces. Startup code
    (for starting new games and loading saved ones) was rewritten. And we have
    experimental LOD (level of detail) support now. It means that models farther
    from the camera will be drawn with less detail, resulting in
    speedups.<br><br>

title=The Boson movies
text=A while ago we promised a surprise - here it comes:<br>
    We present you the Boson movies!<br>
    There are two short movies, showing how Boson can look like.<br>
    The first movie shows an aircraft bombarding the enemy's base and the second
    one shows a big attack of a player against the enemy.<br>
    They were made using scripts (yes, scripting engine has already evolved that
    far) and CVS boson code.<br>
    You can download the movies and find more information about them on the
    <a href="movies.php">movies page</a>.

title=Poll, patents and more
text=First, we have a poll now, so you can vote about some stuff :-)<br>
    The first poll is about what in your opinion is most important for Boson
    right now. Vote and we may take poll's results into account while
    developing.<br>
    On other news, some of you have probably noticed the protest page against
    software patents in Europe. As a part of
    <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/group/demo/index.en.html">bigger campaign</a>
    we replaced the main page with it from 27th August until 1st September. It
    seems the vote itself has been delayed until the end of September, so
    there's still some time for you to
    <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">take action</a>. If software patents will
    be legalized in europe, we (as well as many other open-source projects) may
    not be able to continue our work, because many ideas we use (e.g.
    <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/txt/ep/0394/160/">progress bars</a>)
    are patented.<br>
    About CVS, there is, as always, lots of new stuff there. Most noticeable are
    redesigned startup widgets, new wreckage handling (they now slowly sink
    into ground instead of disappearing at once) and many fixed bugs. Updated
    changelog is available at <a href="status.php">status page</a>.<br>
    And we have a surprise for you coming soon, so check back in a week or so
    ;-)

title=News from CVS
text=I know, we've had total lack of updates, sorry about that. More than four
    months have passed without a single article.<br>
    But Boson is still being actively developed and there are number of new and
    exciting features in current <a href="download.php#cvs">CVS version</a>.<br>
    Here are few of them:
    <ul>
    <li>Units accelerate/decelerate realistically</li>
    <li>New terrain rendering code. Terrain is now drawn using several layers
        which are blended together. This creates nice effect for transitions and
        looks really nice</li>
    <li>Few updated unit models</li>
    <li>New unit: Koyote (a nice helicopter with a cannon)</li>
    <li>New unit: Warthog (A-10 plane with heavy anti-tank missiles)</li>
    <li>New unit: Wolf (a truck which may carry other units in the future)</li>
    <li>You can now add multiple units and draw multiple tiles in editor using
        click+drag</li>
    <li>Ground textures are drawn over multiple cells, making tiling effect less
        visible</li>
    <li>Basic scripting support using Python. Old (dumb) AI has already been
        converted to a script</li>
    </ul>
    More detailed list of changes can be found on the
    <a href="status.php#done">status page</a>.<br>
    The homepage has some new stuff, too. There's new counter and
    <a href="stats.php">statistics page</a> in case you're interested.<br>
    And last, but not least, there are couple of new
    <a href="screenshots.php">screenshots</a> available!
    <br><br>

title=Status update after long time
text=It's been quite long since the last update.<br>
Good new is that we're moving towards 0.8 which will probably be released in
    late March. Of course there are many
    <a href="status.php#done">changes</a> in the current CVS version. To name a
    few bigger:
    <ul>
    <li>Better support for upgrades, including weapon upgrades</li>
    <li>Support for heightmaps. Map is not flat anymore!</li>
    <li>Better selection code</li>
    <li>New XML-based saving format. Saving/loading is still experimental, but
    should work</li>
    <li>Tooltips for units</li>
    </ul><p class="newstext">
    Also, our <a href="screenshots.php">screenshots page</a> is updated. No new
    screens yet, but the page itself is improved. Individual screenshots are now
    also shown inside HTML-page, you can see the comment and date. And
    screenshots are on multiple pages, 10 screens each.<br><br>

title=New year's update
text=Here comes another status update.<br>
    Our last release, 0.7, has been downloaded about 3000 times now. When it was
    released, our homepage received as many hits during the following week
    as it had since September when the new homepage was opened :-)<br>
    Now about CVS. There are already many improvements in our CVS code and we're
    moving forward to 0.8. Biggest changes are:
    <ul><li>Map information is preloaded on startup (no slowdown when changing
    map)</li>
    <li>Particles drawing has been improved</li>
    <li>Big optimizations</li>
    <li>Smaller map format</li>
    <li>Of course, usual bugfixes</li></ul><p class="newstext">
    For more, take a look at the <a href="status.php#done">done section of our
    status page</a>. There are many additions!<br>
    Also, two new <a href="screenshots.php">screenshots</a>, taken from the CVS
    version, are available.<br>
    And last, but not least, code of this homepage is now licenced under GPL
    which means that you can use it to create your own pages, provided that you
    also give note about the original author
    (<a href="mailto:boson-devel@__NOSPAM__lists.sourceforge.net">The Boson Team</a>) and
    a link to this page. And we'd be happy if you'd also mail us, so we know if
    somebody is using it ;-)

title=IMPORTANT: Problem found in 0.7, fix available
text=Many users who downloaded 0.7 reported problems when using 24bpp depth
    or when playing in fullscreen mode. We have found out that the reason for this were too
    big textures which didn't fit into the memory of the videocard and caused
    big slowdowns. A Package containing the fix (scaled-down textures) is available
    from the <a href="download.php#0.7-fix">download page</a>.<br>
    We're sorry for any inconvenience.

title=Dynamic news
text=We have now dynamic news!<br>
    This means that the main page now has a fixed number (currently 5) of articles and
    older articles are in the "Older News" sidebar box. There is also
    <a href="news.php">a page that contains all news articles</a>. Many
    thanks to Brad for this feature!<br>
    About Boson, version 0.7 will most probaly be released in November, so we
    encourage everybody to get <a href="download.php#cvs">a CVS copy of Boson</a>
    and test it. If you find any bugs, please <a href="contact.php#bugs">report
    them</a> so we can fix them before release.<br>
    Biggest changes since the last update include a updated unit editor which now
    supports editing of all current unit properties including weapons.<br>
    A new starting widget for the map editor where you can choose existing maps to edit
    or create new a one (and select it's size).<br>
    And, as always, many bugs have been fixed and many smaller things have been changed.

title=Another update
text=Again, much has changed during the last weeks. I wanted to take some
    screenshots and update our screenshots page, but things just kept changing
    (and they still do :-)) and I didn't want outdated screenies, so they'll
    come later ;-)<br>
    So here is list of updated stuff:
    <ul>
    <li>Missiles are properly rotated</li>
    <li>New map: Basic 2 which is modified version of Basic map</li>
    <li>Added a menu entry and shortcut to grab screenshots. Just press Ctrl+G</li>
    <li>.desktop files were renamed. They now have better suffixes like .boson
      and .unit</li>
    <li>New camera system.</li>
    <li>New loading/saving widget</li>
    <li>Updated units README and added README about particle systems</li>
    <li>Some new units and some updated unit models</li>
    <li>And, of course, bugfixes and many smaller things</li>
    </ul>
    And finally, some statistics: since 1st September or so, our homepage has
    been visited almost 9500 times, more than 200 times a day on average :-)

title=Updates
text= Pretty much has happened during last few weeks.<br>
    Andi added <a href="status.php#features">TODO list to the status page</a>, you
    can now check if your favourite feature will be included in next release.
    (But note that this is an incomplete list and merely shows what needs to be done
    for the next release).
    If it isn't there, you can tell
    us about your wishes via <a href="contact.php#bugs">our bug tracking
    system</a> or <a href="contact.php#mail">write to our mailing list</a>!<br>
    About new features, we now have configurable texture filters (you can choose
    good compromise between speed and quality), shots/missiles support (you can
    see them flying!) and today I added support to configurable particle
    systems, weapons and shots. Everyone can now edit them in configuration
    files, just like units!<br><br>

title=More eyecandy
text= Boson now has particle effects! This means that shots and explosions work
    again! Also, we have smoke clouds for destroyed units and flames for
    half-destroyed facilities. Go to <a href="screenshots.php">screenshots
    page</a> and check out the new screenshots showing explosions and smoke! Or even
    better, update your CVS copy. If you don't have a CVS copy, go to
    <a href="download.php#cvs">the download page</a> for instructions on how to get one!<br>
    Also, here are some updates to this page (mostly style) by Ben.<br>
    We hope you like it!<br><br>

title=New features!
text=I promised to add new features and here comes the first one: you can now
    change the style of this homepage. Just go to the <a href="options.php">options
    page</a> and select the style you like most!<br>
    Currently, there are only two different styles, but if you want more, you
    can write them yourself! All you need to do is to write a new stylesheet that
    specifies the used colors. It's not hard! You can use style-blue.css as
    template. When you're done, send them to
    <a href=\"mailto:rivolaks@__NOSPAM__hot.ee\">me</a>, I'm happy to put them up here!<br><br>

date=September 1st 2002 19:22
title=New homepage
text=Boson has a new homepage! This homepage should be much better than the old
    one, but it's new, so it may contain some errors (I hope it doesn't though).
    If you find an error, please report it to <a href="mailto:boson-devel@__NOSPAM__lists.sourceforge.net">our mailinglist</a><br>
    This is not a modification of our old homepage, it's written from scratch in
    PHP, which hopefully makes it easier to maintain than the old one.<br>
    What has changed compared to the old page? It has a new look which reminds
    the look of the <a href=\"http://www.kde.org/\">KDE homepage</a>. Also, we have
    a couple of new pages: <br>
    <ul><li><a href="install.php">Install</a></li>
    <li><a href="info.php">More information</a></li>
    <li><a href="links.php">Related links</a></li></ul>
    and all pages now have valid HTML and CSS.<br>
    This page is still under development and we're adding new features, so come
    back soon!<br><br>
