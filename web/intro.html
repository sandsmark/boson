    <P>Boson is a real-time strategy game, like Command&amp;Conquer(tm) or StarCraft(tm). It is designed to run on Unix (Linux) computers, uses the <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/qt/">QT Toolkit</a> and the QwSpriteField library. A minimum of two players is required, since there is no artifical intelligence yet. Boson is still in very early development and not playable yet.</P>
