    They are rendered completely in Boson, except for intro/outro sequences<br>
    They do not show actual gameplay, as scripts were used to make them, but
    the game itself looks very similar.<br>
    <br>
    The movies come in three different flavors:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>High quality - has 800x600 resolution and best quality, but is
        also quite big and requires decent computer to play. Recommended for
        users with fast internet connections.</li>
      <li>Medium quality - resolution is 640x480, but it doesn't look
        much worse than high quality one.</li>
      <li>Low quality - with 320x240 resolution, quality isn't the best,
        but it's good for modem users and for previewing before downloading the
        high-quality version.</li>
    </ul>
    All movies are encoded using <a href=\"http://www.xvid.org\">XViD codec</a>.
