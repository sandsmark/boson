    <P>Please consider joining the Boson project. Whatever you would like to do, we need you! Here are some examples of what needs to be done:</P>

    <UL>

    <LI>New Theme: Graphics for the terrain.
    <LI>New Theme: Graphics of units.
    <LI>New Theme: Graphics of facilitites.
    <LI>New Theme: Graphics for the command - panels.
    <LI>A manual for Boson.
    <LI>New Theme: Background Music
    <LI>Sound effects
    <LI>Beta-Test (soon ?)

    </UL>

    <P>If you want to give it a try, here's what you need to do:</P>

    <P>First off, you need to know what exactly you want to be doing. As said above, you could do any kind of graphics, sounds or music etc. Somebody may already be working on this, but you can either team up with him or create your own stuff - don't forget, Boson is themeable. But right now, it might be better to team up (its better to have one thing done than five things started) Oh, before I forget, you could also donate money or hardware :o)</P>
 
    <P>The best thing you can do to get involved is to subscribe to the boson - mailinglist. Then, you could send a mail either to the list or <A HREF = "mailto:BenAdler@Bigfoot.de">me</A> introducing yourself. We will be very happy to answer any of your questions and make contact with other people possibly working on the same kind of stuff.</P>
