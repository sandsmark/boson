    <P><B>Will there be a port to gtk (or any other toolkit) ?</B></P>
    </FONT>

    <FONT FACE="helvetica" SIZE="2">
	Why not ? The code is heavily based on qt/kde libraries, but as many people have already
asked for a gtk port, I will surely separate boson in the future : the core, toolkit-agnostic, and
the GUI part (one for kde, one for gtk..).
	The main purpose is to have a playable game, though, and this won't be done before 1.0, at
best.

    <P><B>What does <b>BOSON</b> stand for ?</B></P>
    </FONT>

    <FONT FACE="helvetica" SIZE="2">
	As far as I know, a <b>boson</b> is a sub-particle. Well... the name was chosen
in a hurry, and I don't have time to find a better one. Feel free to make any proposal to
the <a href="mailto:boson@club.voila.fr">boson mailing list</a>

    <P><B>What about <b>Qt 2 / KDE 2</b> ?</B></P>
    </FONT>

    <FONT FACE="helvetica" SIZE="2">
	Presently, I'm using kde 1.x and qt 1.4x for the development. As soon as I will have a almost
stable kde2/qt2, I will begin the port to it. (the one I have is still.. well.. not for daily
use yet)
	<br>
	<b>Boson</b> 1.0 <b>will need</b> qt2/kde2. That's for sure.
