	Even in the lowest level, boson code make a heavy use of Qt. So it's quite hard to make a generic <b>RTS</b> core engine that is toolkit agnostic.

	<br>
	<br>
	I have plans to make the server Qt-independant, using only standart C component, and no GUI (graphical
user interface), so that the server may be used on any unix-like computer.

	As far as I know, a boson is a sub-particle. Well... the name was chosen in a hurry, and I don't have time to find a better one. Feel free to make any proposal to the <a href="mailto:boson@egroups.fr">boson mailing list</A>.
	<P>
	By the way, we are looking for a new name, as www.boson.org has been stolen by a bad guy who wants us
to pay 500$.

	Have a look at the <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>, it's planned for the next release <b>0.5</b>
	From then on, all boson version will need QT2.1 and KDE 2.0 libraries.

	Not yet. I do use a CVS repository, but as I don't have an internet access at home, I can't put it on aquila (the computer hosting this page).
