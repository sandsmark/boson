    <P>Boson is a real-time strategy game, like Command&amp;Conquer(tm) or StarCraft(tm).
It is designed to run on Unix (Linux) computers and uses the <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/qt/">QT Toolkit</a>
 and QwSpriteField.
A minimum of two players is required, since there is no artifical intelligence (yet?).
Boson is still in very early development and not playable yet.
