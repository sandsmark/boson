This is a copy of mixkit, from
  http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/software/qslim.html
(qslim contains mixkit)

mixkit claims to be under the LGPL, but I believe it is not (see COPYING.txt for
comments on this).

Because we _need_ it to be under the (L)GPL, I have removed the offending files
and thus this is a modified version of mixkit only.
