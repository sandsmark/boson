This is a small test application for lib3ds.
It was written to make sure that lib3ds works correctly on a given platform.

lib3ds has been developed and tested on 32bit x86 machines, so that platform
will work anyway.
Interesting platforms would especially be different 64 bit platforms, big
endian machines (x86 in both, 32 and 64 bit variants are little endian) and
a combination of both.

Instructions:
1. edit SConscript to actually compile the program (atm: set do_testing to 1)
2. cd into the directory (build/bobmfconverter/loaders/lib3ds_test)
3. copy the .3ds from bobmfconverter/loaders/lib3ds_test
4. ./lib3ds_test
-> if it succeeds, lib3ds should be working on this platform
