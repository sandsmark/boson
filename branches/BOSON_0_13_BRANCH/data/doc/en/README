The Boson handbook uses wml (http://www.thewml.org).

----------
Includes
----------
At the moment there are three includes. You can find them in includes ;)
- top.wml
- nav.wml
- footer.wml

top.wml
        This file includes the html header, css, some meta tags, the title and <body>
        You can change the default title:
        #include top.wml title="new title"
        And you can add some params to the body:
        #include top.wml title="new title" body_args="style=background-image:url($(basedir)bg.png);background-attachment:fixed;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:center;"

nav.wml
        This is the navigation used at the bottom of the page.
        This example is from tank.wml:
        #include "nav.wml" before_url="batzen.html" before_text="Batzen" after_url="ship.html" after_text="Ship"
        I think that is self explained.
        You can remove the before_* after_* and top_url vars. Than you will only get <--, --> and ^ without a link. Useful for the first and last file.
        The top link should go to the index.html site in the same directory. If you are on such a index site, go one dir up.

footer.wml
        It adds the "maintained by" line and the </body></html> tags.

facilities.wml
        This will generate a complete facilities page for you.

indexes.wml and indexes_footer.wml
        Simple include for a page index


----------
Eperl
----------
Some parts of the handbook are using perl to get "live data"
This is also done through wml. You can add perl simply like this:
<:
$test = "<tr><td>TEST</td></tr>";
print $test;
:>
Everything that goes to stdout will be included in the html file.
Stderr will end in a wml error.


----------
Facilities
----------
We use wml and perl to get the properties of the buildings and units.
You can find the call of perl in every facilitiy doc file:
<:
use get_values;

# ( facility type, facility name)
get_values->getval("fix", "warfactory");
:>
We import get_values (get_values.pm) and than we call the getval method.
The first param is the facility type, fix == building | mob == unit
The name, you need to enter the name that is used for the folder where the index.unit file is

You can define the values which will be writen to the html files in values.list.
If you wonder where we set @INC: Andreas hacked am_edit, we set $PERLLIB during make.



have fun
