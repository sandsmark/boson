Music in Boson

As of today (2002/01/06) boson supports music.
There are already several tracks available - see http://boson.eu.org/download/index.html
They were made by Nils Trzebin and you can also get them from the boson music
website at http://www.rebellion-scs.de/boson/

To install your own files just create a new directory here (in data/music/)
and re-run make install. 
Also make sure that the newly created directory contains a index.desktop file.
The contents of the file do *currently* not matter.
That's it.

There are also somee tracks provided by the boson team - see
http://boson.eu.org/music
Just untar them in data/
No need to create additional directories.
