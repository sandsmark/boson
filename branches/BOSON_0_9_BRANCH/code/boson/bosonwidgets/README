This is a collection of widgets for use in Qt Designer.
In bosonwidgets/ you'll find libbosonwidgets.la, which contains all widgets that
can be included into designer directly. That library will get used in boson as
well.

bosonwidgets/plugin/ contains the necessary code for the Qt designer plugin and
several dummy classes, for the widgets that can't be used in designer directly
(e.g. the minimap, which depends on Unit and Player and ...)
These dummy classes must not be used in boson.
