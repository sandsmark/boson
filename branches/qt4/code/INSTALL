This is about how to install the *SVN* version of boson!

See http://boson.eu.org/install.php for instructions on installing released
version.

Note: this file might be outdates. http://boson.eu.org provides the most current instructions!


Well.. basically, you need

    code/
    data/

from boson SVN.
see

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/boson

for more info about how to get the SVN modules.

Making the game :
=================

You should _not_ be root to make the game.

Currently you need to do:
  export QTDIR=/path/to/qt
  export KDEDIR=`kde-config --prefix`
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install/to ..
  make
to compile boson.

QTDIR is e.g. /usr/share/qt3 on debian systems.


Installing the game :
=====================
You have to be _root_ to install it.
type : "make install"


Installing data :
=================

Data are in the SVN module "data/"

Repeat exactly the same steps as above, but in the "data" directory instead of
the "code" directory.
