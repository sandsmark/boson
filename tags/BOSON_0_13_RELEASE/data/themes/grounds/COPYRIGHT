All ground files are published under the terms of the GNU GPL.

Here you can find sources of the files - or most of them (we'll probably forget to
add newly added files here. mail boson-devel@lists.sourceforge.net if a file is
missing here).
Some files might have been under a less restrictive license (meaning: it allows
re-licensing) or even under the public domain. They got relicensed by us. Feel
free to use either the original license or the GPL. If the files were modified
by us you *have* to use GPL (or mail us:)).


Every ground consits of lots of pixmaps. I try to name them all - i.e. number of
types and number of versions per type. please keep in mind that more
versions/types/whatever might get added and we probably won't add them here.


"earth"
Currently there are desert, dwater, grass, grass_mineral, grass_oil, water
and water_oil. each type has 4 versions.
additionally the dummy file hidden-00.png.
there are transitions dirs desert_water, dwater_water, grass_desert, grass_water.
every transition has 28 types each with 4 versions. 
finally there is a dir "oil", 4 versions for every ground type.
