Particle systems' configuration README.

This README describes keys of particle system configurations.
Particle systems are used to create effects such as explosions, smoke etc.

Particle system consists of individual particles. Each particle has color,
velocity, current position and age. Particle's age means how long particle lives
or is active. When particle dies or becomes inactive, it is not drawn nor
updated anymore.


Entries:
vector is three floating-point numbers, separated by commas (e.g. 5.7,6.2,-1.2)
color is four floating-point numbers, separated by commas
(e.g 1.0, 0.9, 0.3, 0.55). All of these numbers should be in range 0.0 - 1.0

The rest of this file is about the particles.boson
It contains groups and each group describes one particle system.
This group can contain following entries:

The entries marked with * are mandatory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Group]
* Id=integer
        ID of this particle system. This must be unique! It is used to identify
        particle system. It must be > 0
        No default!
MinVelocity=vector
MaxVelocity=vector
        These two entries specify minimal and maximal velocity of particles.
        Note that every component in MinVelocity vector should be smaller than
        corresponding component in MaxVelocity. Actual velocity of particle will
        be random and between them.
        Default is 0,0,0 for both.
MinPos=vector
MaxPos=vector
        These entries specify initial position of particle.
        Default is 0,0,0 for both.
Normalize=bool
        Whether to normalize velocity vector. If you normalize velocities,
        particle system's shape will be sphere, otherwise they might look like
        boxes, but normalizing takes some time. It's usually good to leave it
        to false for little effects like missile hits or little explosions and
        to set it to true for bigger effects like big explosions or shockwaves.
        Default is false.
MinScale=float
MaxScale=float
        How much to scale vector after normalizing. This has any effect only
        when Normalize is set to true.
        Default is 1 for both.
StartColor=color
EndColor=color
        Specifies color of particle when it borns and when it dies. During
        particle's life, color is dynamically changed from StartColor to
        EndColor.
        Default is 0,0,0,0 for both
MinLife=float
MaxLife=float
        Specifies minimal and maximal lifetime of particle i.e. how long
        particle lives. This is in seconds for normal game speed.
        Default is 0 for both.
MaxNum=integer
        How many particles this particle system may have?
        If this value is too big, particle systems will use too much memory, but
        when it's too little, some particles are not created.
        Usually, good value is InitNum + (Rate * MaxLife)
        Default is 100.
InitNum=integer
        How many particles to create when particle system is created?
        Usually, for explosions, you create all particles or at least most
        particles initially and for smoke you don't create any initial
        particles.
        Default is 0.
BlendFunc=string
        What OpenGL blending function to use? This must be either
        "GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA" or "GL_ONE".
        Default is "GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA".
Rate=float
        How many particles to create per second (with default game speed) when
        particle system is active.
        Default is 0.
Size=float
        Specifies sizes of particles. The bigger this number is, the bigger the
        particles are.
        Default is 1.
SystemLife=float
        Specifies how much particle system lives (in seconds with normal game
        speed). When this time passes, particle system doesn't create any new
        particles.
        If you create all particles initially (Rate is 0), this doesn't have any
        effect
        Default is 0.
Align=bool
        Whether to align particles to camera. If you don't align them, they will
        be aligned to x-y plane (like cells).
        Default is true.
Texture=string
        Texture to use for particles. Textures will be tinted with particles'
        colors.
        Default is "default.png"
