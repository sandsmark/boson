We have two different kinds of sounds:
- sound effects
- speech

Sound effects are currently all in .wav but .ogg would probably ok, too.
Speech should be in .ogg.
Please don't use .mp3 - if you can't create .ogg files you can send me .mp3, too
but please use .ogg if possible.

Boson searches two different locations for sound files - this directory
(species/species_name/sounds/) and the unit subdir:
species/species_name/units/unit_name/sounds/

The first subdif (e.g. species/human/sounds/) is the default dir. When a unit
has no specific sound file the sounds here are used.
If a unit should not use the default sounds place them into the unit directory,
e.g. for the ship:
species/humen/units/mob_ship/sounds/

Sound Effects
-------------
Sound effects are not yet standardized and therefore will change. Currently
there are:
shoot.wav - played when a unit shoots at another unit.

That's all. The other files are not yet supported by code.

Speech
------
Speech files do not necessarily contain speech - but they usually do. The "_0"
in the filename stands for the number of the sound. Currently only 0 is
supported - will change soon. Once we support it a unit chooses one file
randomly of the same type.

order_attack_0.ogg - Played when the unit is ordered to attack something.
order_move_0.ogg   - Played when a unit is ordered to move to another location
order_select_0.ogg - Played when the unit is being selected
report_produced_0.ogg - Played when the unit has been produced. Note this is
                        *not* played when the unit (factory) starts to produce!
report_underattack_0.ogg - Played when the unit is being attacked. Not yet used.
report_destroyed_0.ogg - Guess what? Yes! Played when the unit is destroyed.
