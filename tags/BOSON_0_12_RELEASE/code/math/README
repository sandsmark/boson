This directory contains the math library of Boson.

In this directory, the use of Qt or of any file in code/boson is disallowed.
This is a general purpose library, that can be used outside of the Boson source
tree, too. This is very handy for development (for me at least), as one can
easily write test programs that make use of 3d maths the same way Boson does.
