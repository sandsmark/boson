graphism 
	>now, we have: The picture, the health bar, the status, the progress bar,
	>Damage (number, not a bar), Amor (number, not a bar), Speed (number, not
	>a bar). I that fills it up, cool. If its too much, I don't care, we can
	>cut speed...

mouse handling :
	When you select a unit, rightclick somewhere and it will go there.
	When you select a unit and rightclick on an enemy unit, it will attack.
	When you select a unit and rightclick on resources, it will gather.
	When you select a unit and rightclick somewhere on the radarmap, it will go there.
	When you left click-and-hold and drag on the radarmap, you see that part
	on the right window.
check that loading of pixmap has been done well
	OK for species, ground still needs checking

#good (with _no_ layout)  positionning of widget.
#boAssert( celldiscovered has j<max) seems to have problems
#integration of Ben mobiles (with different colors)
#click-zone for selection is still badly centered
#map : inheritate Cell, and put serverCell back in server dir
#checkvisibility -> units
#	server : add a 'known' state to serverUnits
#	broadcast 'moving' to all people knowing me, and then update 'known'
#everything should be seen by others if ground is known.
#use different pixmap according to 'direction'
#new web page (ben ?)
#bug : select mobile, move, somewhere, can't move somewhere else...
#mobiles can go only on the ground they are allowed to.
#client units : shouldn't move over each other
#make a toolbar with concerned buttons (move, stop, etc..)
#take out the menu
#check Makefile.am for installation "make install"
#Map should be installed in apps/boson/map

0.2 release:
============

basic map editor
	ben's editor :
	>All I want is a
	>area, where I can put my maps together to make some terrain, because I
	>want to see how well it is tilable. It would be great if these maps
	>would "snap" to the corners of a 96x96 grid and if you could
	>-optionally- see the gridlines. There doesn't need to be any "save"
	>feature or so, I can take screenshots if I ever need to. Oh, and it
	>would be great if I could just drag'n'drop the bitmaps from KFM, but
	>that isn't that important...
