      Scrolling
    </h1>
    <p>
      In Boson you have several different ways of scrolling. Pick the one you
      like most :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>1. MiniMap</h4>
      Left click on the minimap centers the display on the point you clicked in
      the mini map.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>2. MMB Scrolling</h4>
      You can click using the middle mouse button somewhere on the big display
      (i.e.
      the map where you can select the units) to center the display on that
      point.
      Note that you need 3 mouse buttons for this ;-)
      Usually you can press both mouse buttons at once to emulate a middle mouse
      button click - this should work as well then.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>3. RMB Scrolling</h4>
      Click somewhere in the big display
      and hold the mouse button. Now move the mouse with the righ mouse button
      still pressed and the display follows your mouse movements. Release to stop
      scrolling.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>4. Cursor Keys</h4>
      You can also use the cursor keys to scroll the display. There is not much
      to say about this - except that you can configure the step-size of a curser key.
      Go to Settings->Configure Boson and change the number for "Arrow Key Steps".
      Simply enter your desired pixel value.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>5. Cursor at the Edge of the window</h4>
      <i>(Currently at an experimental state!)</i><br>
      You can also scroll by moving the cursor at the edge of the window. Move
      the
      cursor at the edge of the main window and wait a moment. That's it.
      Please note that you you may have some problems with this if you are not
      playing
      in fullscreen mode. We recommend to play in fullscreen mode!
