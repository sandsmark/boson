    <h3>General</h3>
    <a name="gen_1">- When is Boson finished ?</a>
    <p>&gt;&gt; When boson is up and running with a level already loaded in the moment you
    think about starting boson - then we can release 1.0 ;-) &lt;&lt;
    </p>
    <br>

    <a name="gen_3">- How can I submit a bug report ?</a>
    <p>
    You can submit a bugreport through <a href="http://bugs.kde.org/wizard.cgi" target="_blank">bugs.kde.org</a>.<br>
    Or simply start Boson, you will find the "Report Bug..." entry in the "Help" menu.<br>
    If you don't get a menu on startup than hit the right mouse button and select "Show Menubar".<br>
    Please include a backtrace if you have one. Also, if self compiled, configuring with "--enable-debug=full" helps us.<br>
    If you have speed problems, please klick <a href="#game_2">here</a>.
    </p>
    <br>

    <a name="gen_98">- Are there other supported languages than english ?</a>
    <p>No, Boson is a game in development, text changes very often. It is hard to maintain different languages yet.
    </p>
    <br>

    <a name="gen_99">- Boson crashed my computer, what can I do ?</a>
    <p>It looks like some people have a problem with a Boson/KDE/OpenGL/malloc/driver combination.<br>
    If you have total crashes or kernel memory errors please start Boson under an other window manager like fvwm2 or failsave.<br>
    The system crashes should go away but please contact us because we need more people with the same problem.<br>
    A possible fix might be a kernel update to 2.4.20+.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Game</h3>
    <a name="game_1">- Where is the menubar ?</a>
    <p>
    To enable the application menubar press the right mouse button on the welcome screen and click on "Show Menubar".
    </p>
    <br>

    <a name="game_2">- Why is boson so slow ?</a>
    <p>
    There may be many reasons, some things that can help:<br>
    - Check your hardware: <a href="started.html">here</a><br>
    - Try resizing the window and/or make it smaller<br>
    - Increase the update interval in the Boson settings<br>
    - Turn off light and materials<br>
    - Change the color depth of your XServer to 16bit<br>
    - Check the speed of other OpenGL games like tuxkart and tuxracer, maybe they also run slow<br>
    - Start the program called "<a href="game/apps.html">boinfo</a>" and check if the values under this tabs are correct:<br>
        <blockquote>
        <table border="0" class="nav">
            <tr><th colspan="2" align="left">OpenGL</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Is Direct</td><td>Yes</th></tr>
            <tr><th colspan="2" align="left">NVidia</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Textfield *</td><td>No errors found...</td></tr>
            <tr><th colspan="2" align="left">Operating System</th></tr>
            <tr><td>TDFX *</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Have MTRR</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        </table>
         * If you are using this driver
        </blockquote>
    <br>
    If all that doesn't help you can send a bugreport to the <a href="mailto:boson-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">mailing list</a>.
    Please don't send other bugs to the mailinglist, see <a href="#gen_3">here</a>.<br>
    To find speed problems we need more information:<br>
    - Save the information from "<a href="game/apps.html">boinfo</a>". You can save them under "Files".<br>
    - Some seconds after startup of a game you will get a message that you can make profiling snapshots with Ctrl+P.<br>
    &nbsp; Send both files with a description of your speed problem to our mailinglist.
    </p>

    <a name="rend_1">- Are there options to improve 3D rendering ?</a>
    <p>
    Note, this things will make Boson slower!<br>
    NVIDIA:<br>
    <code>__GL_FSAA_MODE=5</code><br>
    <code>__GL_DEFAULT_LOG_ANISO=3</code><br>
    Export this as variables on your console before starting Boson.<br>
    You will have to look at your NVIDIA driver documentation for the
    correct values since the are different from card to card.<br>
    Other:<br>
    If you have informations about other cards/drivers please drop us a note.
