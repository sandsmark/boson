Ok this is work in progress so a lot of things might and probably will change
(or have already changed when you read this).
Nevertheless here the description of the themes/species/*/units directory (where
"*" is currently "human" only).

All units in boson are derived from the "Unit" class and therefore they all
share one common directory - facilities as well as mobile units.
All files which belong to a unit of this species belong to its directory in
themes/species/*/units/unit_dir - unit_dir is the unique directory of the unit.
It doesn't matter how you name this directory - however a prefix like mob_ and
fix_ might be useful when working on the units. But this depends on you.

Currently a unit must have at least 2 overview bitmaps (overview-big.bmp and
overview-small.bmp) which are shown when the unit is selected (big) and as a
button in the construction facility (small). 
The big overview must have s size of 180*110 (AB: ??? probably smaller)
The small overview must have a size of ??
A facility has 5 sprites, a mobile unit 9.  
The sprites of the facilities show the 4 construction steps 
(from initial to completely built) while a mobile unit has 8 different directions. 
The last one is the "destroyed" pix. 
The files of the sprites are named field-000N.bmp where N is the number of the
sprite (0..8 or 0..4).

Additionally all units have index.desktop file in their directories. This file
describes the unit. It has first a common group shared by all units: 
"[Boson Unit]" (without the quotation marks). This group can contain the 
following entries:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Boson Unit]
IsFacility=boolean  - True if this is a facility, false if this is a mobile
                      unit. 
                      Default is false.
* Name=Text         - The Name of the unit. Should be short, no more than 2 or 3
                      words. One if possible.
                      Default is "Unknown".
* Id=Number         - A unique (!) ID for this unit. Must be > 0.
                      No default!
Health=Number       - Health, power, whatever. Make this greater and the unit will
                      live longer. Must be > 0. 
                      Defaul is 100.
Shield=Number       - Not yet supported. 
                      Default is 0.
Armor=Number        - Not yet supported. 
                      Default is 0.
MineralCost=Number  - How much mineral do you have to pay if you build this? 
                      Default is 0.
OilCost=Number      - How much oil do you have to pay if you build this? 
                      Default is 0.
Range=Number        - The weapon range (>= 0) of this unit. 
                      Default is 0.
SightRange=Number   - The sight range (>= 0) of this unit. 
                      the sight range is how far (in cells!) this unit can see.
                      Default is 5 (currently).
Damage=Number       - The damage this unit makes to other units when firing. Can
                      also be negative - the unit repairs then. 
                      Default is 0.
Reload=Number       - The time (>= 0) to reload the weapon. "Time" means number of
                      advance calls (ca 1 per 50ms). 
                      Default is 0.
TerrainType=Number  - The default terrain type of the unit. One of 0 (Land), 
                      1 (Water) or 2 (Air).
                      You must decide for one - even if the unit is some kind
                      of mixture. If so you will probably use Land (0). 
                      The default is 0 (=Land Unit)
ProductionTime=Number - The number of advance calls needed to produce this unit
                        Default is (currenlty) 100.
CanShootAtAirUnits=bool  - Can this unit shoot at aircrafts?
                           Default true for TeeeainType=2, otherwise false.
CanShootAtLandUnits=bool - Can this unit shoot at ground units? True or False.
                           Default is true for TerrainType=0 or TerrainType=1, 
                           otherwise false.
Producer=Number     - Specifies which kind of factory is able to produce this 
                      unit. Possible values are: 0=war factory (heavy land 
                      units, all types of vehicles), 1=shipyard (all ships), 
                      2=airport (all aircrafts), 3=barracks (soldiers,
                      human units), 10=command bunker (all facilities).
                      Please note that there is currently only a single factory
                      for every Producer type, but we might add more one day
                      (e.g. a mobile factory). The possible productions of those
                      factories will also depend on the Producer type.
                      The default is the value of "TerrainType" for mobile units
                      and 10 (= command bunker) for facilities.
SupportMiniMap=bool - If true then this player has a minimap when he has a unit
                      of this type. The minimap disappears when all units of the
                      player which have SupportMiniMap=true are gone.
                      Default is false.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The entries marked with * are mandatory.

The number of mandatory entries can increase in the future. This is still work
in progress.
You should provide as many entries as possible although you don't have to.

Also note that all entries support (as of KConfig) the possibility to create
localized versions. You can e.g. use "Name[de]=German Name" or so. Use this
feature where it is useful. I doubt this is useful for something like Id ;-)


Beside this general group there are (currently) two additional groups: 
"[Boson Mobile Unit]" and "[Boson Facility]". 
These groups contain all mobile unit/facility specific stuff (like the
speed for a unit).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Boson Mobile Unit]
Speed=Number         - Value of the speed of the unit. A unit will move that many
                       pixels per advance call. This is a double number so values
                       like "0.452463" are possible as well.
		       Default is 0
CanGoOnLand=boolean  - Whether this unit can go over land. 
                       This is true by default for TerrainType = Land or
		       Aircraft.
CanGoOnWater=boolean - Whether this unit can go over water. 
                       This is true by default for TerrainType = Water or 
		       Aircraft.
CanMineMinerals=boolean - Whether this unit can mine minerals.
                          Default is false.
CanMineOil=boolean   - Whether this unit can mine oil.
                       Default is false .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Boson Facility]
CanProduce=Boolean  - True if something can be produced here. 
                      Default is false.
ProducerList=List   - CanProduce must be true for this.
                      The List is a comma separated list of Producer IDs.
                      The facility will be able to produce all units with the
                      "Producer" entry that is listed here.
                      Default is an empty List.
