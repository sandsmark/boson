Every action has an own directory (e.g. "move/" or "attack/"). All must be
provided.

Every dir has a index.desktop file, that describes the cursor. Contents:

[Boson Cursor]
CursorPrefix=text    -  The prefix of the filename. Default: "cursor-". Then
                        *must* follow a 4-digit number (0000, 0001, 0002, ...)
                        and then .png! Only .png are supported.
FrameCount=number    -  The number of files you provide. This must be at least
                        1! Note that file naming starts with zero!
                        Default is 1.
HotspotX_n=number    -  The horizontal hotspot of the cursor - file n. Example:
                        HotspotX_0=0
                        This means that the file cursor-0000.png has the
                        horizontal hotspot at 0.
                        HotspotX_32=68
                        Means that the file cursor-0032.png has the
                        horizontal hotspot at 68.

                        If you don't specify all of the hotspots, the alway the
                        last read is used. E.g. You have
                        HotspotX_0=3
                        HotspotX_32=22
                        Then all frames cursor-0000.png up to cursor-0031.png
                        have HotspotX=3. All following files have HotspotX=22
HotspotY_n=number    -  See above.


Note that if we *want* to support x-cursors, too (our animated cursors are
actally sprites). But at this moment the support is broken. If I ever add it
again then this will probably be a file in cursors/ directly.
Probably this will be
cursors/move.xpm
where the animated cursors are in
cursors/move/
