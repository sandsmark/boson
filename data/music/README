Music in Boson

As of today (2002/01/06) boson supports music.
There are already several tracks available - see http://boson.eu.org/download/index.html
They were made by Nils Trzebin and you can also get them from the boson music
website at http://www.rebellion-scs.de/boson/

To install them just create a new directory here (in data/music/) and edit
data/music/Makefile.am: music_DATA is a space separated list that should contain
all of the directories you are going to install, e.g.:
music_DATA = Jungle Progressive

now re-run make (perhaps also cd data/ ; make -f Makefile.cvs ; ./configure) and
make install. That's it.
