/** \page config_header configuration header 

\ref proposal_state

bksys provides support for creating configuration related include headers (config.h), which 
contains definitions collected by the configuration process performed with \b scons \bconfigure like 
autotool does. 

The developer only have to include the global config.h file into his source and to write conditional code 
for using specific functions or headers. 

\section config_types supported configuration types 

- c header files
- c/c++ functions 
- additional libraries 

\section config_include_source using config.h

Developers apply config header support by wrapping related include files with a preproccesor conditional 
like shown below for the system include header <b>sys/types.h</b>: 

\code
#include "config.h"
...
...
#ifdef HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H
#include <sys/types.h>
#endif 
\endcode


\section config_header_internals config.h internals 

The global config.h is includes .... 

topics: 
- use of directory related config-<dir>.h files 
- use of module related config-<module>.h files 
- usage of library presence -> #define HAVE_LIBART 
- usage of library version  -> #define HAVE_LIBART <version>
