Game TODOs
- waypoints
- constructing - maybe use Boson::slotDelayedAddUnit() or so? - partially done
- make player color selectable in the new game dialog
- use different cursors for moving, attacking, ...
- fog of war (long time TODO)


Editor (map, unit, scenario) TODOs
- don't place units on invalid tiles (e.g. ship on grass)
- unit editor (should be quite easy cause of config files) - mostly done
- unit editor: check if images are in the directory, provide possibility to copy
  them


General TODOs
- zooming (QCanvas::setWorldMatrix())
- rename Unit->UnitBase ; VisualUnit->Unit
- SpeciesTheme loads all pixmaps into memory - share it between different
  players (if they have the same themes)
- bosoncommandframe: a qgridlayout with a orderbutton count of (16?) - must be dividable by 3. the
  bottom 3 buttons are: left is a down (aka next page) , middle is free, right
  is a up (aka previous page) button. SO we can add any number of pixmaps with
  this limited number of orderbuttons.
