Game TODOs
- waypoints
- unit accelleration: units should slowly start to accelerate and to brake when
  moving
- BosonPath doesn't honor fog of war
- remove wreckages after a certain timeout
- left dbl-click should select ALL units of that type
- auto-attacking when unit is in range
- end of game - winner ; statistics
- fullscreen mode
- scroll if cursor at the edge of the window
- auto positioning of produced units
- rewrite fog of war (QCanvas suckz): use QCanvasSprite::hide() on all units and
  let the Cell display black. Don't use a QCanvasSprite for the fog of war.
  Terrible performance.
- display how many (and which) units are still in queue for production
- BosonPath needs to be improved greatly
- AI
- BosonCanvas::unitsAtCell() uses QCanvas::collisions() and is therefore quite
  slow. it is used by BosonPath which is not (yet) time critical but it can be
  improved. *maybe* we'll add a QPtrList to all cells which contains all units
  at this cell. So we'd have to use collisions() only to check *which* parts
  (coordinates, rect, whatever) of the cell(s) is occupied by the unit. This
  would improve the speed heavily but adding a QPtrList to every cell would be
  terrible for memory usage... it *might* be worth...


Editor (map, unit, scenario) TODOs
- don't place units on invalid tiles (e.g. ship on grass)
- unit editor (should be quite easy cause of config files) - mostly done
- unit editor: check if images are in the directory, provide possibility to copy
  them

General TODOs
- zooming (QCanvas::setWorldMatrix()) - mostly done
- selection rect is not working correctly if zooming in
- SpeciesTheme loads all pixmaps into memory - share it between different
  players (if they have the same themes)
- find out whether signalUnitPropertyChanged() is a good thing at all. Might
  save some performance if we don't use it.
- use typeId = 0 as invalid (NOT -1!)
- the selection rect is not drawn correctly if it is started when the mouse is
  already moving
- add revision (CVS) number of files to the connection protocol. If the versions
  differ then deny connection. This ensures that all clients are at the smae
  version. We need the revision number of each file - how to do add this
  automatically?
  We can do this using static const char filename_id = "$Id:";
- BosonTiles: use KPixmapSplitter (kdelibs/kdefx)
- IdReloadState also makes Player emit signalUnitChanged() - this might become a
  performance problem!! we need it for BosonCommandWidget
- Use BosonCanvas::unitCollisionsInRange() wherever useful
- transmit everything on startup over network (== map, unitProperties). This
  saves us from a cheating player who (maybe just accidently) changed the files
  (units/*/index.desktop especially).
- OptionsDialog: default position of commandframe

Data TODOs
- replace .bmp files by .png ones (done - need to commit)
- fix the pixmap naming: file.00nn.bmp -> file-00nn.png (done - need to commit)
- general sound (e.g. speech)
