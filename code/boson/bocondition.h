/**
 * Objects of BoCondition are always part of a @ref BoEventListener (or part of
 * another BoCondition object).
 *
 * A BoCondition object is a collection of events and status conditions that
 * <em>all</em> must have been received or fullfilled in order to make the
 * condition be fullfilled (see @ref thisConditionDone).
 *
 * Events that are received are checked using @ref BoEventMatching for whether
 * they match an event in the condition.
 * StatusConditions are calls to script functions.
 *
 * Another way of fullfilling a BoCondition object, is by fullfilling an
 * "alternative" object. While all Events/StatusConditions in a BoCondition
 * object are connected using AND, several BoCondition objects can be connected
 * using OR (i.e. every single BoCondition is a conjunction and together with
 * its alternatives, they build up a disjunctive normal form).
 *
 * When a condition is fullfilled, you (i.e. the event listener) should call
 * @ref fireAction, that emits an action (such as emitting an event, or
 * displaying a system chat message).
