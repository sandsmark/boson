The *_decl_p.h files are generated from the *.boglc files in specs/ and
specs/extensions/.

TODO: auto-generate them, i.e. let cmake do that.
  -> I have not yet been able to figure out a way to do that: we need bogl.h to
     depend on these files, so that they are generated whenever bogl.h is used
     somewhere, however I have no clue how to do that.
     -> dependencies on .cpp files are easy (set_source_files_properties with
        OBJECT_DEPENDS), but I have no idea how to do that for headers.
