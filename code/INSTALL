This is about how to install the *SVN* version of boson!

See http://boson.eu.org/install.php for instructions on installing released
version.


Well.. basically, you need

    code/
    data/

from boson SVN.
see

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/boson

for more info about how to get the SVN modules.

Making the game :
=================

You should _not_ be root to make the game.

WARNING: the following is subject to change. We are currently investigating
build system alternatives. The install instructions _will_ change in the future!

Currently you need to do:
  tar xjvf bksys/scons-mini.tar.bz2
  ./scons configure prefix=/opt/kde3 debug=yes
to set up the build system for an installation to /opt/kde3. Then do a
  ./scons
to compile boson.


Installing the game :
=====================
You have to be _root_ to install it.
type : "./scons install"


Installing data :
=================

Data are in the SVN module "data/"

Repeat exactly the same steps as above, but in the "data" directory instead of
the "code" directory.
