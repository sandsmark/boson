mouse handling :
	When you select a unit, rightclick somewhere and it will go there.
	When you select a unit and rightclick on an enemy unit, it will attack.
	When you select a unit and rightclick on resources, it will gather.
	When you select a unit and rightclick somewhere on the radarmap, it will go there.
	When you left click-and-hold and drag on the radarmap, you see that part
	on the right window.
check that loading of pixmap has been done well
	OK for species, ground still needs checking

#good (with _no_ layout)  positionning of widget.
#boAssert( celldiscovered has j<max) seems to have problems
#integration of Ben mobiles (with different colors)
#click-zone for selection is still badly centered
#map : inheritate Cell, and put serverCell back in server dir
#checkvisibility -> units
#	server : add a 'known' state to serverUnits
#	broadcast 'moving' to all people knowing me, and then update 'known'
#everything should be seen by others if ground is known.

	>-optionally- see the gridlines. There doesn't need to be any "save"
