-------

-	f	Add the configuration variables into another environment called "config"
		and not into "env" directly.
		The reason is that scons makes deep copies of everything and that
		'env' needs to be duplicated for every new obj.
		## after some testing it looks like this is wrong
		## using copies is not exensive, gaining 3 seconds on 1 minute is not worth the effort

2	n	extend bksys help option to display options defined set by the opts.AddOptions() 
		this provides old configure help options list (used by 4) 
			-> move help printing after opts.Update(env)
			-> add "print opts.GenerateHelpText(env)" before return 

3	n	dcop, kdecore and other test apps require RUNTESTS to be compiled, currently there 
		is no support for this 
		
-	n	implement library dependency support like libtool does, required for static libraries 
		like KDE-ICE and libltdlc.a and uninstalled shared (from kde-buildsystem@kde.org) 

-	n	cleanup QT related component definition
		QT is something like QT + zlib, QTGUI is QtCore + QTGui

-	n	find a platform independent way to include all symbols from static libraries into a 
		shared library (gcc-notation: -Wl,--whole-archive ... -Wl,--no-whole-archive )

-	f	cleanup multiple definitions of command line options like PREFIX, which is defined in 
		generic.py, kde3.py and qt4.py 

-	n	cleanup '#' and '##' prefix meaning, recently '#' refers to the source root and 
		'##' refers to ?? (I found it refers to /)
    
-	f	fix or report doxygen parsing problem in generic.py 
		## 1.4.5 works better 

-	f	make libtool support optional, disable by default and create <target-name>.dep 
		without content for each library target as platform independent dependency link 

mac related

unix related
------------

-	f	some configure checks does not setup the related compiler/linker flags from pkgconfig for example openssl 

win32 related 
-------------
  			 						
2	n	fix installation of files  (dll's are in lib dir instead of bin, which is in path)

3	n	document platform option platform=<QT Platform specifier>  
		currently supported: win32-g++, win32-msvc.net 

-	n	implement openssl detection without pkgconfig or support pkgconfig on windows

-	n	split qt debug options from KDE debug options, it is not always required to use qt debug library with KDE 

-	n	document how to debug KDE with gdb on windows
