      About Boson
    </h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
	Boson is an OpenGL real-time strategy game, with the feeling of
	Command&Conquer&trade or StarCraft&trade and OpenGL support.
	It is designed to run on Unix (Linux) computers, and is built on top of the libkdegames, kde and Qt libraries.<br>
	A minimum of two players is required, since there is no artificial intelligence yet.
