The Boson handbook uses wml (http://www.thewml.org).

----------
Includes
----------
At the moment there are three includes. You can find them in includes ;)
- top.wml
- nav.wml
- footer.wml

top.wml
	This file includes the html header, css, some meta tags, the title and <body>
	You can change the default title:
	 #include top.wml title="new title"
	 And you can add some params to the body:
	 #include top.wml title="new title" body_args="style=background-image:url($(basedir)bg.png);background-attachment:fixed;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:center;"

nav.wml
	This is the navigation used at the bottom of the page.
	This example is from tank.wml:
	 #include "nav.wml" before_url="batzen.html" before_text="Batzen" after_url="ship.html" after_text="Ship"
	I think that is self explained.
	You can remove the before_* or after_* vars. Than you will only gett <-- and --> without a link. Useful for the first and last file.
	The index link always goes to the main index file of the handbook.

footer.wml
	It adds the "maintained by" line and the default </body></html>


----------
Perl
----------
Some parts of the handbook are using perl to get some "live data"
This is also done through wml. You can add perl simply like this:
<:
$test = "<tr><td>TEST</td></tr>";
print $test
:>
Everything that goes to stdout will be included in the html file.
Stderr will end in a wml error.
