a map file contains information about the map *only*
It contains information about the tiles (cells) and (or only this?)
it can (? TODO) contain information about maximal and minimal players but no
more!
Information about max/min players probably fit better to scenario files.

It does *not* contain data about the units of the players. These data are stored
in the scenario files. See there for further information.

The map filename can be any (you'll probably use the english map name) with a
suffix of ".bpf" (TODO: what does bpf stand for?).
Additionally there is a file with the same name but a suffix of .desktop.
So the basic map would have the files
basic.bpf
basic.desktop

The .desktop file contains further information about the map. This is mainly the
localized name and a short description. The structure of this file:

[Boson map file]
Name=Basic
Name[de]=German name of Basic
Comment=Basic is... Basic!
Comment[de]=German translation of the comment

The .desktop file consists of a single group "[Boson map file]". It supports the
following entries:
Name=Text     - The name of the map. Translated versions can be created with
                [de] after Name, where de is the language. See KDE/KConfig for
                information about possible language letters. 
                Note that you don't have to provide a translated version. If you
                don't do the english name is used (which makes often more
                sense).
Comment=Text  - A short text about your map. Can also be translated.
