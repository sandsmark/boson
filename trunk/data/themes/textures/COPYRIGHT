All texture files are published under the terms of the GNU GPL.

Here you can sources of the files - or most of them (we'll probably forget to
add newly added files here. mail boson-devel@lists.sourceforge.net if a file is
missing here).
Some files were under a less restrictive license (meaning: it allows
re-licensing) or even under the public domain. They got relicensed by us. Feel
free to use either the original license or the GPL. If the files were modified
by us you *have* to use GPL (or mail us:)).

Most files are from golgotha - which was developed by crack.com, but never
finished and then released to the public domain. You can find the original files
here: http://jonathanclark.com/golgotha/browse.html
They were *really* released as public domain - meaning you can do just
everything with it - relicense, sell, use, ...
