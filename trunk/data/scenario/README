Just a few ideas here currently:
the map file contains information about the map itself (cells/tiles). See
map/README.

The scenario file should first contain the map on which the scenario is being
played. This map must be unique! (imagine you add a ship and on map A this is on
water and on map B it's on land...)

Then the scenario file contains information about players (min/max players) and
their units (count, type, position).

Currently that's all. Very much under construction.
