    <P>Although these things might still change, it might be helpful to know how to issue some of the commands already existing in Boson. Right now, you can / must use only the mouse. Later, we will add some keyboard shortcuts and maybe some kind of a toolbar.</P>

	<b>Game</b>

    <UL>

    <LI>To select a unit or building, leftclick on it. You can select multiple units by holding down the left mousebutton and pulling a rectangle around them.</LI>

    <LI>To construct a new building, select the command bunker, leftclick on the facility you want to build and leftclick in the view to place it.</LI>
    
    <LI>To construct a new unit, select the warfactory, leftclick on the unit you want to build and leftclick in the view to place it.</LI>

    <LI>To move a unit, select it and set its target by right-clicking on the map.</LI>

    <LI>To attack your enemy, select your unit(s) and rightclick on the enemy's unit / building.</LI>

    <LI>You can recenter the map by middleclicking on any point in the view.</LI>
    
    </UL>

	<b>Editor</b>

	<UL>

	<li>When a simple ground (no transition) is selected, you may move the mouse while clicking
	to <i>fill</i> the field.

	<li>While filling you may hold the shift key : it will help you a lot I guess :-)
