    <P>To install boson, you need two packages: One for the code and one for the graphics. You can get both from SourceForge CVS. See <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> on how to download them</P>

    <P>First you need to link the admin dir from code to data (ln -s code/admin data/admin). Now you can make/install both (make -f Makefile.cvs ; ./configure ; make ; make install). You can make the game as a user (and you should do so) but you probably need to install (make install) it as root.</P>

    <P>You should now find the boson entries in the KDE start menu. If anything goes wrong and you cannot find the problem or you think it's our fault, please send a mail to the <A HREF = "mailto:boson-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">boson team</A>, we'll be happy to answer any questions.</P>
