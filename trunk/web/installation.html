    <P>To install boson, you need two packages: One for the code and one for the graphics. If possible, download both packages in the <i>bunzip2</i>, otherwise in the <i>gunzip</i> format, since <I>bunzip</I> files are generally smaller.</P>

    <P>The game code should be extracted to $KDEDIR/share/apps, where it will create a subdirectory called "boson".</P>

    <P>The graphics file should be extracted to $KDEDIR/share/apps/ where it will create a subdirectory in <I>boson</I> called <I>themes</I>.</P>

    <P>If you downloaded the source files, you will have to compile the game before being able to play. After installing the files, please proceed with the standard installation procedures. Go into the boson directory, and enter "./configure", followed by "make", which may take some time. Then, become superuser, and enter "make install". You should now find the boson entries in the KDE start menu.</P>
