<p class=\"announcement\">
Release of Boson 0.10, a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game for the K Desktop
Environment.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
The main focus of this release are dependencies. Boson does not depend on
arts/kdemultimedia and kdegames/libkdegames anymore, instead boson requires
OpenAL for sound. You can find a hopefully complete list of the dependencies at
<a href=\"http://boson.eu.org/info.php\">http://boson.eu.org/info.php</a>
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Another core feature is improved level of detail code. You can look at a large
area of the map containign many units without significant speed loss now. Also
there are many other performance related improvements in this release.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
On a non technical side the most important feature is probably the new
harvesting code. Harvesting both, minerals and oil, is now supported. We
believe this is a big step to make boson fully playable.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Last but not least there are ongoing improvements on our AI code. The computer
players have now the ability to produce units.
</p>


<p class=\"announcement\">
The most important changes in this version:<br>
 - libkdegames is included in this release. You do not need to have it
   installed anymore.<br>
 - Arts is not used anymore, OpenAL is used for sound instead, fixing many
   problems.<br>
 - Mineral and oil harvesting is supported<br>
 - Many performance improvements<br>
 - Improved pathfinding<br>
 - Neutral player added<br>
 - Elementary AI<br>
 - Huge amount of bugfixes<br>
