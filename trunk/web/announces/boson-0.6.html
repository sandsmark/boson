<h3><i>
Boson 0.6 released
</i></h3>


<plaintext>
Release of Boson 0.6, a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game for the K Desktop 
Environment.

Boson still requires a minimum of two players, as there is not yet an 
artificial intelligence. The game is still under heavy development and
0.6 is merely a milestone rather than a fully playable game. We are in need of 
more developers, especially graphics artists. If you have any
spare time and the ability to code in Qt/C++ or know your way around a 
graphics program, please feel free to pop in and offer a hand.

After a year long hiatus (the last release being in October, 2000), Boson was 
revived by a new set of developers. It is now completely
ported to KGame in libkdegames, which provides player and network management. 
Boson 0.6 is a complete rewrite from it's predecessor,
with not a single line of code remaining untouched.

Because of recent changes in the source code, the 0.6 release does not include 
the map editor (see boson-devel archives at
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=6890). We have, however, 
been working very hard to ensure that this the only
limitation compared to the last release (0.5). Due to the massive overhaul 
necessary to bring Boson to this point, a changelog was not
possible.

Major changes and additions since version 0.5:
- auto-shoot: Defensive buildings automatically shoot at enemies when they are 
in range. Normal units do not do this yet.
- split views: you can split a display and play at several places on the map 
at once
- full network capability (please note that single player mode is quite boring 
without an AI)
- fog of war
- mineral/oil harvesting (experimental)
- fullscreen mode
- Map and scenario files are now XML based (was originally binary). All units 
can be configured using KConfig syntax
- music, sound and speech
- pathfinding (thanks to some excellent work by it's hacker!)
- Most units actually have "sense", e.g. if your Comsat station is destroyed 
your minimap will disappear.

Dependencies
To compile and install Boson, you will need (other than the usual compiler 
tools):
- Qt 3 (see http://www.trolltech.com)
- KDE 3 (see http://www.kde.org)
  - kdelibs
  - kdegames (at least libkdegames)
  - kdemultimedia for sound support (might not compile without it, as we 
didn't test)
Please note that you need the development files (e.g. headers) of all these 
packages. We do not (yet) provide binary packages.

Installing Boson
There are two methods of installing Boson (from tarballs). The easier way is 
to grab boson-all-0.6.tar.bz2. However, that file is very big, and
if you are on a slow connection, you may wish to just get the code and data 
packages. The required packages can be found at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15087.

Let me say that again: download either boson-all or both boson-code and 
boson-data. Do not waste your time downloading all three!

If you decided to grab the individual packages, you can optionally download 
the music files for Boson at http://boson.eu.org/music/.
 
The installation itself:
  Decompress the package(s):
  % tar xjvf <package name>
  cd into each directory and:
  % ./configure
  % make
  As root:
  # make install

Tarball checksums and sizes for the paranoid:
File name               Description             Size    MD5 Checksum
boson-all-0.6.tar.bz2   Everything              27.6 MB 92e5b16f3bdc7d31238d23d298793e15
boson-code-0.6.tar.bz2  The Boson game engine   501 kB  3d7b8b3967c5ada20b0ae80c56517aad
boson-data-0.6.tar.bz2  Graphics, sounds        10.9 MB 0e470b3f089424da3dc1cb05a0230a6b
boson-music-0.6.tar.bz2 Music (optional)        16.6 MB f777b7a232ef55eb23c0b547fc335873
