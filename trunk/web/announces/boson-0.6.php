<h3 class=\"announcement\">
Boson 0.6 released
</h3>
<p class=\"announcement\">
Release of Boson 0.6, a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game for the K Desktop
Environment.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Boson still requires a minimum of two players, as there is not yet an
artificial intelligence. The game is still under heavy development and
0.6 is merely a milestone rather than a fully playable game. We are in need of 
more developers, especially graphics artists. If you have any
spare time and the ability to code in Qt/C++ or know your way around a 
graphics program, please feel free to pop in and offer a hand.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
After a year long hiatus (the last release being in October, 2000), Boson was
revived by a new set of developers. It is now completely
ported to KGame in libkdegames, which provides player and network management. 
Boson 0.6 is a complete rewrite from it's predecessor,
with not a single line of code remaining untouched.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Because of recent changes in the source code, the 0.6 release does not include
the map editor (see boson-devel archives at
<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=6890\">http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=6890)</a>. We have, however,
been working very hard to ensure that this the only
limitation compared to the last release (0.5). Due to the massive overhaul 
necessary to bring Boson to this point, a changelog was not
possible.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Major changes and additions since version 0.5:<br>
- auto-shoot: Defensive buildings automatically shoot at enemies when they are 
in range. Normal units do not do this yet.<br>
- split views: you can split a display and play at several places on the map 
at once<br>
- full network capability (please note that single player mode is quite boring 
without an AI)<br>
- fog of war<br>
- mineral/oil harvesting (experimental)<br>
- fullscreen mode<br>
- Map and scenario files are now XML based (was originally binary). All units 
can be configured using KConfig syntax<br>
- music, sound and speech<br>
- pathfinding (thanks to some excellent work by it's hacker!)<br>
- Most units actually have \"sense\", e.g. if your Comsat station is destroyed
your minimap will disappear.<br>
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Dependencies<br>
To compile and install Boson, you will need (other than the usual compiler 
tools):<br>
- Qt 3 (see <a href=\"http://www.trolltech.com\">http://www.trolltech.com</a>)<br>
- KDE 3 (see <a href=\"http://www.kde.org\">http://www.kde.org</a>)<br>
  - kdelibs<br>
  - kdegames (at least libkdegames)<br>
  - kdemultimedia for sound support (might not compile without it, as we 
didn't test)<br>
Please note that you need the development files (e.g. headers) of all these 
packages. We do not (yet) provide binary packages.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Installing Boson<br>
There are two methods of installing Boson (from tarballs). The easier way is
to grab <a href=\"http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/boson/boson-all-0.6.tar.bz2?download\">boson-all-0.6.tar.bz2</a>. However,
that file is very big, and if you are on a slow connection, you may wish to just
get the code and data packages. The required packages can be found at
<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15087\">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15087</a>.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Let me say that again: download either boson-all or both boson-code and
boson-data. Do not waste your time downloading all three!
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
If you decided to grab the individual packages, you can optionally download
the music files for Boson at
<a href=\"http://boson.eu.org/music/\">http://boson.eu.org/music/</a>.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
The installation itself:
  Decompress the package(s):
</p>
<pre>% tar xjvf &lt;package name&gt;</pre>
<p class=\"announcement\">
  cd into each directory and:
</p>
<pre>% ./configure
% make</pre>
<p class=\"announcement\">
  As root:
</p>
<pre># make install</pre>
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Tarball checksums and sizes for the paranoid:
