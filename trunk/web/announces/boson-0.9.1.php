<p class=\"announcement\">
Release of Boson 0.9.1, a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game for the K Desktop
Environment.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
This is a bugfix release, fixing a couple of important problems in boson 0.9
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Both the data and the music packages are unchanged, so if you already
downloaded and installed them (or maybe the -all package) you need the code 
package only this time.
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Nearly complete changelog (since <a href=\"boson-0.9.php\">Boson 0.9</a>):<br>
- Network with kdegames from KDE < 3.2 is fixed<br>
- Minor file format fix, that causes less trouble with network<br>
- Ground texture pixmaps are loaded correctly in the editor<br>
- Factory productions are saved correctly<br>
- Try to find a usable GL font, even if Qt doesn't find any<br>
- Don't crash when using proprietary NVidia drivers and no usable font was
found (reported to NVidia nearly a year ago)<br>
</p>

<p class=\"announcement\">
Requirements<br>
You can find a list of hardware and software requirements at
<a href=\"http://boson.eu.org/info.php\">http://boson.eu.org/info.php</a><br>
