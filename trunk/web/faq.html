	Why not ? The code is heavily based on qt/kde libraries, but as many people have already asked for a gtk port, I will surely separate boson in the future : the core, toolkit-agnostic, and the GUI part (one for kde, one for gtk..). The main purpose is to have a playable game, though, and this won't be done before 1.0, at best.

	As far as I know, a boson is a sub-particle. Well... the name was chosen in a hurry, and I don't have time to find a better one. Feel free to make any proposal to the <a href="mailto:boson@egroups.fr">boson mailing list</A>.

	Presently, I'm using kde 1.x and qt 1.4x for the development. As soon as I will have a almost stable kde2/qt2, I will begin the port to it. (the one I have is still.. well.. not for daily use yet). boson 1.0 will need qt2/kde2, that's for sure.

	Not yet. I do use a CVS repository, but as I don't have an internet access at home, I can't put it on aquila (the computer hosting this page).
