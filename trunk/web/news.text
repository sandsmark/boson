title=Dynamic news
text=We have now dynamic news!<br>
    This means that the main page now has a fixed number (currently 5) of articles and
    older articles are in the "Older News" sidebar box. There is also
    <a href="all-news.php">a page that contains all news articles</a>. Many
    thanks to Brad for this feature!<br>
    About Boson, version 0.7 will most probaly be released in November, so we
    encourage everybody to get <a href="download.php#cvs">a CVS copy of Boson</a>
    and test it. If you find any bugs, please <a href="contact.php#bugs">report
    them</a> so we can fix them before release.<br>
    Biggest changes since the last update include a updated unit editor which now
    supports editing of all current unit properties including weapons.<br>
    A new starting widget for the map editor where you can choose existing maps to edit
    or create new a one (and select it's size).<br>
    And, as always, many bugs have been fixed and many smaller things have been changed.

title=Another update
text=Again, much has changed during the last weeks. I wanted to take some
    screenshots and update our screenshots page, but things just kept changing
    (and they still do :-)) and I didn't want outdated screenies, so they'll
    come later ;-)<br>
    So here is list of updated stuff:
    <ul>
    <li>Missiles are properly rotated</li>
    <li>New map: Basic 2 which is modified version of Basic map</li>
    <li>Added a menu entry and shortcut to grab screenshots. Just press Ctrl+G</li>
    <li>.desktop files were renamed. They now have better suffixes like .boson
      and .unit</li>
    <li>New camera system.</li>
    <li>New loading/saving widget</li>
    <li>Updated units README and added README about particle systems</li>
    <li>Some new units and some updated unit models</li>
    <li>And, of course, bugfixes and many smaller things</li>
    </ul>
    And finally, some statistics: since 1st September or so, our homepage has
    been visited almost 9500 times, more than 200 times a day on average :-)

title=Updates
text= Pretty much has happened during last few weeks.<br>
    Andi added <a href="status.php#features">TODO list to the status page</a>, you
    can now check if your favourite feature will be included in next release.
    (But note that this is an incomplete list and merely shows what needs to be done
    for the next release).
    If it isn't there, you can tell
    us about your wishes via <a href="contact.php#bugs">our bug tracking
    system</a> or <a href="contact.php#mail">write to our mailing list</a>!<br>
    About new features, we now have configurable texture filters (you can choose
    good compromise between speed and quality), shots/missiles support (you can
    see them flying!) and today I added support to configurable particle
    systems, weapons and shots. Everyone can now edit them in configuration
    files, just like units!<br><br>

title=More eyecandy
text= Boson now has particle effects! This means that shots and explosions work
    again! Also, we have smoke clouds for destroyed units and flames for
    half-destroyed facilities. Go to <a href="screenshots.php">screenshots
    page</a> and check out the new screenshots showing explosions and smoke! Or even
    better, update your CVS copy. If you don't have a CVS copy, go to
    <a href="download.php#cvs">the download page</a> for instructions on how to get one!<br>
    Also, here are some updates to this page (mostly style) by Ben.<br>
    We hope you like it!<br><br>

title=New features!
text=I promised to add new features and here comes the first one: you can now
    change the style of this homepage. Just go to the <a href="options.php">options
    page</a> and select the style you like most!<br>
    Currently, there are only two different styles, but if you want more, you
    can write them yourself! All you need to do is to write a new stylesheet that
    specifies the used colors. It's not hard! You can use style-blue.css as
    template. When you're done, send them to
    <a href=\"mailto:rivolaks@hot.ee\">me</a>, I'm happy to put them up here!<br><br>

title=New homepage
text=Boson has a new homepage! This homepage should be much better than the old
    one, but it's new, so it may contain some errors (I hope it doesn't though).
    If you find an error, please report it to <a href="mailto:boson-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">our mailinglist</a><br>
    This is not a modification of our old homepage, it's written from scratch in
    PHP, which hopefully makes it easier to maintain than the old one.<br>
    What has changed compared to the old page? It has a new look which reminds
    the look of the <a href=\"http://www.kde.org/\">KDE homepage</a>. Also, we have
    a couple of new pages: <br>
    <ul><li><a href="install.php">Install</a></li>
    <li><a href="info.php">More information</a></li>
    <li><a href="links.php">Related links</a></li></ul>
    and all pages now have valid HTML and CSS.<br>
    This page is still under development and we're adding new features, so come
    back soon!<br><br>
