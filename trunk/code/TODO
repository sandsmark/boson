TODO:


Generic :
=========

editor/boson : mapping different signal to ONE function (int signal_nb) is possible with qt2
ben's bug

units construction : progressbar on unit_constructor, then autoput of the unit
fine-graining for *Theme.cpp : distinc loading of overview..
units : revoir le design global
selectPart shouldn't be splitted
QCanvas : shouldn't segfault when pixmap loading has failed

move boson/handleGameMessage into field
creating things only if ressources permit it (presently, the server already refuse to build)
positionning rect in editor/boson


move boson.h into bosonapp.h (socket handling / generic stuff)
	      and boWindow.h (KTMainWindow ...)

positionning rect in editor/boson
read/save Options has been removed (was using an olg buggy kdevelop code)
bug : mobile on very-bottom-right can't be selected [still exact?]
smoother moves (using float instead of int for VirtualSprite?)
black background ??
change miniDisplay to be gpp-indep, then move it to visual
move logfile initialisation into common/
fullscreenmode
Initial dialog:
	give 'world' name
	give 'species' names
	version check whithin the ask_connect msg
Unit drawing into minimap : moving, etc...
does units::rect need to be virtual anymore ?
server : check that each unit does max 1 move each jiffie
different subclass for my_units and other_units in client
fog of war

graphism 
	>now, we have: The picture, the health bar, the status, the progress bar,
	>Damage (number, not a bar), Amor (number, not a bar), Speed (number, not
	>a bar). I that fills it up, cool. If its too much, I don't care, we can
	>cut speed...
	>

mouse handling :
	When you select a unit and rightclick somewhere on the radarmap, it will go there.
	When you left click-and-hold and drag on the radarmap, you see that part
	on the right window.


boson:
	checkMove should handle the new 'direction'

visual:
	merge boshot and speciesTheme pixmap loading stuff

editor:
	close -> how to say KTMW that there's no mainWidget anymore ? 
	predefined 'template' for construction.


0.5 release:
============
client and server should be peer-killed proof
check the .bfp format (no binary changes should be allowed after 0.5)
	-> check for 'version' 'author' and other meta-information especially
check compilation in map/
minimap should work (for ben)
editor should be pre0.1
"unit" tree cleaning
"move" cleaning
"connect" cleaning
"sound" and "music" for nils


test 'yellow' team colorization with ben's examples..
