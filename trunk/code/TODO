#23 f: serverCell should inherits Cell (bosonCell+=requested, serverCell+=knownby)
#27 f: use of QPoint/QSize all over canvas/toplevel
#28 f: remove EX() in common/unitType.cpp -> need lot of checking
#30 f: new boDist() and use of it all over the place
#34 b: editor : "close map" not working -> the file is closed, but the user has no feedback
#38 b: selected units should be on a TopLevel basis (see multiple window in editor fe)

#56 b: nmap makes the server crashes. should logDD("new attempt rejected"), or close the socket when eo is here
#57 f: check if qcanvas can handle png's transparency
#58 f: editor/boson : mapping different signal to ONE function (int signal_nb) is possible with qt2

#60 f: fine-graining for *Theme.cpp : distinct loading of overview..
#61 f: selectPart shouldn't be splitted (up/down)

#63 f: clean up the network code : what handles what ? and in which file..
#64 f: proposiong/creating things only if ressources permit it in client (presently, the server already refuse to build)

#71 f: fullscreenmode (for ben :)

#106 f: shift-RMB does nothing in editor for oil/mineral ground
#107 f: oil/mineral info should be in the TIME_ msg, cause anyway, they are sent in every data-burst
