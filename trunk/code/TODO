0.1 release : (june, 15th?)
=============

does units::rect need to be virtual anymore ?

bug : mobile on very-bottom-right can't be selected

how to handle selection drawing ?
menu clean-up :-)

when clicking (no box) on two mobiles, both are selected, but shouldn't
	then -> client units : shouldn't move over each other

checkvisibility -> units
#	server : add a 'known' state to serverUnits
	broadcast 'moving' to all people knowing me, and then update 'known'

use different pixmap according to 'direction'
server : check that each unit does max 1 move each jiffie
version check whithin the ask_connect msg
map : inheritate Cell, and put serverCell back in server dir

check that loading of pixmap has been done well
	OK for species, ground still needs checking

#good (with _no_ layout)  positionning of widget.
#boAssert( celldiscovered has j<max) seems to have problems
#integration of Ben mobiles (with different colors)
#click-zone for selection is still badly centered

check Makefile.am for installation "make install"

Website : documentation about
	communication protocol,
	how-to-make-theme(with naming convention)
