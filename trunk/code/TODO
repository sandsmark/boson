=============

bug : select mobile, move, somewhere, can't move somewhere else...

bug : mobile on very-bottom-right can't be selected
what about drag and dropping units ? :-)
how to handle selection drawing ?
menu clean-up :-), and also toolbar and so on.
when clicking (no box) on two mobiles, both are selected, but shouldn't
	then -> client units : shouldn't move over each other
checkvisibility -> units
#	server : add a 'known' state to serverUnits
	broadcast 'moving' to all people knowing me, and then update 'known'
everything should be seen by others if ground is known.
use different pixmap according to 'direction'
server : check that each unit does max 1 move each jiffie
version check whithin the ask_connect msg

check that loading of pixmap has been done well
	OK for species, ground still needs checking

#good (with _no_ layout)  positionning of widget.
#boAssert( celldiscovered has j<max) seems to have problems
#integration of Ben mobiles (with different colors)
#click-zone for selection is still badly centered
#map : inheritate Cell, and put serverCell back in server dir

check Makefile.am for installation "make install"
