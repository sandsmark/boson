TODO:


Generic :
=========
(b=bug, f=feature)


#2 b: when destroyed while selected, facilities are still selected (you can keep on building fe)
#5 f: server detects end-of-game / winner..
#8 f: editor handles multiple players (adding players..)
#11 f: fixed units attacking
#23 f: serverCell should inherits Cell (bosonCell+=requested, serverCell+=knownby)
#27 f: use of QPoint/QSize all over canvas/toplevel
#28 f: remove EX() in common/unitType.cpp -> need lot of checking
#30 f: new boDist() and use of it all over the place
#34 b: editor : "close map" not working
#38 b: selected units should be on a TopLevel basis (see multiple window in editor fe)
#39 f: generic statusbar in visualTopLevel, so we can have units# in editor too
#41 f: display info on selected units (power, what is doing and so on..)
#42 f: sound support (arts)
#43 f: music support (arts)
#44 f: auto-positionning of newly built mobile units by server (need #23)
#45 f: auto-attacking units when opponents units are "near"
#46 b: small shots still have black background (need ben' new graphic)
#48 f: oil decreasing when units are moving
#54 f: clean up the maxX/maxY redonduncies
#55 f: minimap size dynamically choosen (50x50 should use 2x2 pixels/tile)
#56 b: nmap makes the server crashes. should logDD("new attempt rejected"), or close the socket when eo is here
#57 f: check if qcanvas can handle png's transparency
#58 f: editor/boson : mapping different signal to ONE function (int signal_nb) is possible with qt2
#59 f: units construction : progressbar on unit_constructor, then autoput of the unit
#60 f: fine-graining for *Theme.cpp : distinct loading of overview..
#61 f: selectPart shouldn't be splitted (up/down)
#62 b: report to QCanvas/author : shouldn't segfault when pixmap loading has failed
#63 f: clean up the network code : what handles what ? and in which file..
#64 f: proposiong/creating things only if ressources permit it in client (presently, the server already refuse to build)
#65 f: positionning rect in editor/boson (you see where you'll put the facility)
#66 f: split boson.h into bosonapp.h (socket handling / generic stuff) and boWindow.h (KTMainWindow ...)
#67 f: read/save config has been removed (was using an olg buggy kdevelop code)
#68 b: mobile on very-bottom-right can't be selected [still exact?]
#69 f: smoother moves between two "sync"
#70 f: move logfile initialisation into common/
#71 f: fullscreenmode (for ben :)
#72 f: in Initial dialog: give 'world' name, 'species' names and  version check whithin the ask_connect msg
#73 f: clean Unit drawing into minimap : moving, etc...
#74 f: server : check that each unit does max 1 move each jiffy
#75 f: dnd the minimap should move the screen
#76 f: directon are still not handled after new positionning scheme (0.5)
#77 f: releasiing some predefined 'templates' for the editor
#78 b: use checkMove() in boeditor as well
#79 f: latest facilities from ben aren't used
