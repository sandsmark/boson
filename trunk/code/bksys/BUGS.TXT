BUGS
====


generic
-------
* installing versioned libraries is broken at the very moment (ita: works with the miniscons provided)
    
mac
----


unix
----
* SConscript containing "#!/usr/bin/env scons -u" in the first line and run with ./SConscript 	
  does not work -> error "No such file or directory"  (from kde-buildsystem@kde.org)

rh: couldn't this be extended in any way so that running ./SConscript works too, may be a good feature. 


win32
-----
* mingw: fix bug in lowlevel.py not detecting winsock gethostname() function 
* fix double global.h occurance (kjs/global.h and kio/kio/global.h), which results in including the wrong file
