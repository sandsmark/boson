/**
 * @short Class that handles mouse movement diffs.
 * In boson you are often in a situation where the user presses a button and
 * you must do someting with all mousemove events that occur from then on
 * until the button is released again. Examples are
 * @li RMB scrolling
 * @li selection rect
 * @li model rotation using the mouse in borender
 * This class can be used for this.
 *
 * You basically call @ref moveEvent in every @ref QWidget::mouseMoveEvent of
 * the relevant widget. When the button is pressed initially (i.e. in the @ref
 * QWidget::mousePressEvent) you call it once again to reset old values.
 * Whenever you need to know how far the mouse was moved since the last move
 * event, you can use @ref dx and @ref dy.
 *
 * For advanced use, you can use @ref start, @ref stop and @ref isStopped. The
 * latter will tell you whether the button, that was @ref start'ed is still
 * pressed. Note that in @ref moveEvent it is also checked whether the button is
 * still pressed and @ref stop gets called if this is not the case.
