Game TODOs
- waypoints
- constructing - maybe use Boson::slotDelayedAddUnit() or so? - partially done
- make player color selectable in the new game dialog
- unit accelleration: units should slowly start to accelerate and to brake when
  moving
- selectpart: static memory should be deleted
- BosonPath doesn't honor fog of war
- MiniMap does not know about units when removing fog of war
- remove wreckages after a certain timeout
- left dbl-click should select ALL units of that type
- auto-attacking when unit is in range
- auto positioning of produced units
- end of game - winner ; statistics
- display progress of unit production
- don't allow to build units when player has not enough minerals/oil
- fullscreen mode
- scroll if cursor at the edge of the window


Editor (map, unit, scenario) TODOs
- don't place units on invalid tiles (e.g. ship on grass)
- unit editor (should be quite easy cause of config files) - mostly done
- unit editor: check if images are in the directory, provide possibility to copy
  them

General TODOs
- zooming (QCanvas::setWorldMatrix()) - mostly done
- selection rect is not working correctly if zooming in
- SpeciesTheme loads all pixmaps into memory - share it between different
  players (if they have the same themes)
- bosoncommandframe: a qgridlayout with a orderbutton count of (16?) - must be dividable by 3. the
  bottom 3 buttons are: left is a down (aka next page) , middle is free, right
  is a up (aka previous page) button. SO we can add any number of pixmaps with
  this limited number of orderbuttons.
- player should select team color in new game dialog
- fimd out whether signalUnitPropertyChanged() is a good thing at all. Might
  save some performance if we don't use it.
- use typeId = 0 as invalid (NOT -1!)
- the selection rect is not drawn correctly if it is started when the mouse is
  already moving
- bigger minimap


Data TODOs
- replace .bmp files by .png ones
- fix the pixmap naming: file.00nn.bmp -> file-00nn.png
- music (background)
- general sound (e.g. speech)
