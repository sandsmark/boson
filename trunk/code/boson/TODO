Game TODOs
- waypoints
- unit accelleration: units should slowly start to accelerate and to brake when
  moving
- rewrite fog of war (QCanvas suckz): use QCanvasSprite::hide() on all units
  and. We could also use QCanvas::drawForeground() to get rid of the
  QCanvasSprites. But there is also a problem when scrolling the widget - all
  units are visible for a moment then (until the fow is drawn). Bug is in
  QCanvas: when the widget is scrolled QCanvas does not use double buffering
  let the Cell display black. Don't use a QCanvasSprite for the fog of war.
  Terrible performance.
- AI
- follow-mode for units
- BosonCommandWidget should paint the order pixmap only *once* no more. E.g. we
  repaint for setGrayOut() and setProductionCount()
- BosonSpriteCursor::slotAdvance() calls canvas->update(). it should not as it
  hurts performance. But it is necessary for slow game speed :(
- refine minerals/oil
- mine/harvest minerals/oil is only at an experimantal state
- oil towers: they should be placed on an oil field. oil tankers go to the
  towers and receive the oil from them, which they take to the refinery
- pathfinding doesn't support units with size > BO_TILE_SIZE. get rid of
  MobileUnit::boundingRect() hack
- let the player configure how often the different advance methods are called.
  E.g. advanceNone() when work()==WorkNone and so on. We should use a
  KGameProperty with PolicyClean, since it *must* be *exactly* the same value on
  every client. A frontend with settings like "best performance" == call
  advance methods seldom and stuff like this would also be nice
- pause
- sprite cursor seems to lead to crashes sometimes when moving the mouse (very
  seldom only)
- don't display the firepower-bar (i.e. reload bar) when the unit/facility
  cannot shoot
- display "filling" status of harvesters instead of firepower. use different
  colors!


Editor (map, unit, scenario) TODOs
- totally broken, currently
- don't place units on invalid tiles (e.g. ship on grass)
- unit editor: check if images are in the directory, provide possibility to copy
  them
- unit editor: add an additional page for the description of the unit (longer
  text - should go into the handbook). Should be able to contain images and so
  on. Maybe use plain docbook or so
- use another options dialog. we MUST NOT provide the possibility to change the
  game speed!!
- don't load BosonTiles twice: once for QCanvas::setTiles and once for
  BoOrderWidget
- write EditorWidget for editor which should replace BosonWidget that doesn't
  support editor anymore

General TODOs
- zooming (QCanvas::setWorldMatrix()) - mostly done
- SpeciesTheme loads all pixmaps into memory - share it between different
  players (if they have the same themes)
- find out whether signalUnitPropertyChanged() is a good thing at all. Might
  save some performance if we don't use it.
- use typeId = 0 as invalid (NOT -1!)
- add revision (CVS) number of files to the connection protocol. If the versions
  differ then deny connection. This ensures that all clients are at the smae
  version. We need the revision number of each file - how to do add this
  automatically?
  We can do this using static const char filename_id = "$Id:";
- BosonTiles: pehaps use KPixmapSplitter (kdelibs/kdefx)
- IdReloadState also makes Player emit signalUnitChanged() - this might become a
  performance problem!! we need it for BosonCommandWidget
- transmit everything on startup over network (== map, unitProperties). This
  saves us from a cheating player who (maybe just accidently) changed the files
  (units/*/index.desktop especially).
- splitViews: we could use one view for players that are allied with the local
  player. we need to transmit the position of the view over network... would be
  a nice idea!
- make sure that kdemultimedia is installed - perhaps disable .ogg support
  somehow if it isn't
- sometimes when splitting displays (maybe only when splitting vertically) it
  happens that no mouse IO is being added (and is therefore unusable and
  unremovable
- canvas text: we want a static non-moving text in the upper right corner
  displaying the resources of the player. up to now all implementations flicker
  in any way...

Data TODOs
- sound for minimap activated/deactivated
- sound for destroyed facilities - shouldn't be speech i guess
- missile sound - e.g. for the samsite
- shipyard
- airport 
- rewrite installation code:
  -> when a dir is renamed currently the old remains on disk and therefore is
     read by the game
