Game TODOs
- waypoints
- unit accelleration: units should slowly start to accelerate and to brake when
  moving
- AI
- BosonCommandWidget should paint the order pixmap only *once* no more. E.g. we
  repaint for setGrayOut() and setProductionCount()
- mine/harvest minerals/oil is only at an experimantal state ; same about
  refining
- oil towers: they should be placed on an oil field. oil tankers go to the
  towers and receive the oil from them, which they take to the refinery
- pathfinding doesn't support units with size > BO_TILE_SIZE. get rid of
  MobileUnit::boundingRect() hack
- let the player configure how often the different advance methods are called.
  E.g. advanceNone() when work()==WorkNone and so on. We should use a
  KGameProperty with PolicyClean, since it *must* be *exactly* the same value on
  every client. A frontend with settings like "best performance" == call
  advance methods seldom and stuff like this would also be nice
- pause
- display "filling" status of harvesters instead of firepower. use different
  colors!
- TopWidget::slotNewGame() is broken
- "welcome to Boson" text in startup screen should be translateable (we can use
  QPainter to paint it to pixmap)
- Do not start game before all players have loaded their data
- BosonTiles::mTilesImage is unused in game mode. free memory
- mark selected units, i.e. display the group number in the selectbox (and also
  in the cmd frame for every unit)
- maybe provide UnitGroups without keyboard, too. select units, click on a
  (empty) button to store that group. another click on that button restores the
  group. rmb on that button deletes it
- Use different config file fields for repairing and weapon damage. Then unit
  that can repair can also shoot at enemies.
- Support more than 1 weapon per unit. Think of a unit that has one weapon for
  air units and other one for land units.
- make clear that "building mode" is enabled. maybe replace the cursor by the
  facility that should get built.
- display on the map where a facility can be placed. maybe change the cursor to
  the facility when user clicks on the completed facility in the cmd panel (see
  above) and gray the cursor out or so when you cant place the building there.
- cmd bunker should display "completed" for completed facilities in the cmd
  frame. player should left click this then in order to select it for placement
  on the map. Currently the player has to click on the cmd bunker only (not on
  the order button) to start placement
- Make shield reloading speed configurable
- fix minimap-zooming. there are a few bugs when the viewport is not at top left
  of the map and we therefore have to call QPainter::translate().
- samsite should be more vulnerable when the doors are open. decrease armor
  then. we need to provide some config entries for indes.desktop for this,
  specifying the frame number when armor changes. note that the frame number for
  this must NOT depend on the .3ds file!
- does load() and save() also work with plugins? they use the same dataHandler()
  as units do - but at least the current plugin must be stored/loaded
- many methods depend on a factory to be a facility. remove this dependance. a
  production plugin can be part of a mobile unit, too
- BUG: units go through near clip and are "broken" when you zoom in above some
  tall facility or aircraft
- move the addToCells() call from Unit::moveBy() to BosonItem::moveBy()!
- a savegame dialog. most RTS game don't ask the player to handle filenames but
  rather provide a list of savegames with additional information, such as date,
  map, players, ...

Editor (map, unit, scenario) TODOs
- don't place units on invalid tiles (e.g. ship on grass)
- unit editor: check if images are in the directory, provide possibility to copy
  them
- unit editor: add an additional page for the description of the unit (longer
  text - should go into the handbook). Should be able to contain images and so
  on. Maybe use plain docbook or so
- use another options dialog. we MUST NOT provide the possibility to change the
  game speed!!
- write EditorWidget for editor which should replace BosonWidget that doesn't
  support editor anymore

General TODOs
- find out whether signalUnitPropertyChanged() is a good thing at all. Might
  save some performance if we don't use it.
- add revision (CVS) number of files to the connection protocol. If the versions
  differ then deny connection. This ensures that all clients are at the smae
  version. We need the revision number of each file - how to do add this
  automatically?
  We can do this using static const char filename_id = "$Id:";
- BosonTiles: pehaps use KPixmapSplitter (kdelibs/kdefx)
- IdReloadState also makes Player emit signalUnitChanged() - this might become a
  performance problem!! we need it for BosonCommandWidget
- transmit everything on startup over network (== map, unitProperties). This
  saves us from a cheating player who (maybe just accidently) changed the files
  (units/*/index.desktop especially).
- splitViews: we could use one view for players that are allied with the local
  player. we need to transmit the position of the view over network... would be
  a nice idea!
- make sure that kdemultimedia is installed - perhaps disable .ogg support
  somehow if it isn't
- make sure that libogg and so on is installed! even if kdemultimedia is
  installed it may still be that ogg support is missing
- use KDock for the dispalys
- hostname lineedit in BosonNetworkOptionsWidget seems to have wrong
  BackgroundOrigin  update: it's not wrong, it's disabled-color
- pixmaps on startup widgets should be centered horizontally
- Use KMD5 to calculate checksum of map and unitProperties at the beginning of
  game and transfer only needed things over network. Saves some traffic
- Minimap doesn't support units with width or height not equal to BO_TILE_SIZE
- Click+Move in minimap should move the rectangle (aka the screen position)
- remove zooming support. maybe replace it by simple cameraZ position changes.
  especially remove BosonBigDisplayBase::setZoomFactor() and the menu entry.
- unit editor does not support plugins
- Don't load UnitProperties and technologies and other stuff in SpeciesTheme
  constructor
- ./configure allows --without-gl

Data TODOs
- sound for minimap activated/deactivated
- sound for destroyed facilities - shouldn't be speech i guess
- missile sound - e.g. for the samsite
- shipyard
- airport 
- rewrite installation code:
  -> when a dir is renamed currently the old remains on disk and therefore is
     read by the game
- the text on the startup pixmap should be translatable. maybe we can use a
  QPainter to paint on it?
- can we use a coded gradient instead of the startup-bg pix? would allow every
  size then
- background story - especially descriptions of the units
- maps
- other species
- document [Sounds] in units/README
- write a script/program that parses the .3ds files and then outputs the
  textures that are in cvs but not used
