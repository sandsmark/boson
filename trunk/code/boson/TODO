Game TODOs
- waypoints
- make player color selectable in the new game dialog
- unit accelleration: units should slowly start to accelerate and to brake when
  moving
- selectpart: static memory should be deleted
- BosonPath doesn't honor fog of war
- MiniMap does not know about units when removing fog of war
- remove wreckages after a certain timeout
- left dbl-click should select ALL units of that type
- auto-attacking when unit is in range
- end of game - winner ; statistics
- fullscreen mode
- scroll if cursor at the edge of the window
- constructing - maybe use Boson::slotDelayedAddUnit() or so? - partially done
- don't allow to build units when player has not enough minerals/oil
- auto positioning of produced units
- display progress of unit production
- RMB + mouse move => move map


Editor (map, unit, scenario) TODOs
- don't place units on invalid tiles (e.g. ship on grass)
- unit editor (should be quite easy cause of config files) - mostly done
- unit editor: check if images are in the directory, provide possibility to copy
  them

General TODOs
- zooming (QCanvas::setWorldMatrix()) - mostly done
- selection rect is not working correctly if zooming in
- SpeciesTheme loads all pixmaps into memory - share it between different
  players (if they have the same themes)
- bosoncommandframe: a qgridlayout with a orderbutton count of (16?) - must be dividable by 3. the
  bottom 3 buttons are: left is a down (aka next page) , middle is free, right
  is a up (aka previous page) button. SO we can add any number of pixmaps with
  this limited number of orderbuttons.
- player should select team color in new game dialog
- fimd out whether signalUnitPropertyChanged() is a good thing at all. Might
  save some performance if we don't use it.
- use typeId = 0 as invalid (NOT -1!)
- the selection rect is not drawn correctly if it is started when the mouse is
  already moving
- bigger minimap
- add revision (CVS) number of files to the connection protocol. If the versions
  differ then deny connection. This ensures that all clients are at the smae
  version. We need the revision number of each file - how to do add this
  automatically?


Data TODOs
- replace .bmp files by .png ones
- fix the pixmap naming: file.00nn.bmp -> file-00nn.png
- music (background)
- general sound (e.g. speech)
