- waypoints
- constructing - maybe use Boson::slotDelayedAddUnit() or so?
- unit editor (should be quite easy cause of config files)
- zooming (QCanvas::setWorldMatrix())
- rename Unit->UnitBase ; VisualUnit->Unit
- SpeciesTheme loads all pixmaps into memory - share it between different
  players (if they have the same themes)

- bosoncommandframe: a qgridlayout with a orderbutton count of (16?) - must be dividable by 3. the
  bottom 3 buttons are: left is a down (aka next page) , middle is free, right
  is a up (aka previous page) button. SO we can add any number of pixmaps with
  this limited number of orderbuttons.
- map editor: big tiles are currently placed as small ones only

- BosonMap: i18n (of the world name) is a TODO. Maybe use a mapfile.desktop file
  which contains the worldname and a short description
- compress map and scenario files
