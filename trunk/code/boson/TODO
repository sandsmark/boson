This list is mostly obsolete. Use bugs.kde.org instead.

Game TODOs
- waypoints
- pathfinding doesn't support units with size > BO_TILE_SIZE. get rid of
  MobileUnit::boundingRect() hack
- let the player configure how often the different advance methods are called.
  E.g. advanceNone() when work()==WorkNone and so on. We should use a
  KGameProperty with PolicyClean, since it *must* be *exactly* the same value on
  every client. A frontend with settings like "best performance" == call
  advance methods seldom and stuff like this would also be nice
- "welcome to Boson" text in startup screen should be translateable (we can use
  QPainter to paint it to pixmap)
- mark selected units, i.e. display the group number in the selectbox (and also
  in the cmd frame for every unit)
- maybe provide UnitGroups without keyboard, too. select units, click on a
  (empty) button to store that group. another click on that button restores the
  group. rmb on that button deletes it
- cmd bunker should display "completed" for completed facilities in the cmd
  frame.
- Make shield reloading speed configurable
- samsite should be more vulnerable when the doors are open. decrease armor
  then. we need to provide some config entries for indes.unit for this,
  specifying the frame number when armor changes. note that the frame number for
  this must NOT depend on the .3ds file!
- Add screenshots support to saving/loading widget
- Add support for playing sound in a loop. E.g. for missile fly sound
- Add support for miner sounds (mining/unloading)

Editor (map, unit, scenario) TODOs
- unit editor: add an additional page for the description of the unit (longer
  text - should go into the handbook). Should be able to contain images and so
  on. Maybe use plain docbook or so

General TODOs
- add revision (CVS) number of files to the connection protocol. If the versions
  differ then deny connection. This ensures that all clients are at the smae
  version. We need the revision number of each file - how to do add this
  automatically?
  We can do this using static const char filename_id = "$Id:";
- transmit everything on startup over network (== map, unitProperties). This
  saves us from a cheating player who (maybe just accidently) changed the files
  (units/*/index.unit especially).
- hostname lineedit in BosonNetworkOptionsWidget seems to have wrong
  BackgroundOrigin  update: it's not wrong, it's disabled-color
- pixmaps on startup widgets should be centered horizontally
- Use KMD5 to calculate checksum of map and unitProperties at the beginning of
  game and transfer only needed things over network. Saves some traffic
- Click+Move in minimap should move the rectangle (aka the screen position)
- Debugging mode: when this is selected in the menu, the cmdframe is switched
  into a "debugging" display. it just displays data about several aspects.
  mainly about the cursor position - e.g. when the cursor is above a unit, is
  should display the name/type/id and the position of the unit. also it should
  display the actual screen and canvas/world position of the cursor, so that it
  can be checked whether these values are corred (ie the unit is _really_ under
  the cursor). we could display the cell coordinates that would be under the
  cursor, if the unit was not there, as well.
  we may of course display additional data, such as fps, map size, unit count,
  ...

Data TODOs
- sound for destroyed facilities - shouldn't be speech i guess
- missile sound - e.g. for the samsite
- shipyard
- airport
- rewrite installation code:
  -> when a dir is renamed currently the old remains on disk and therefore is
     read by the game
- the text on the startup pixmap should be translatable. maybe we can use a
  QPainter to paint on it?
- can we use a coded gradient instead of the startup-bg pix? would allow every
  size then
- sounds for miner (mining/unloading, maybe when player commands unit to mine)
- better shooting sounds
- explosion sounds
