/**
 * There has always been one problem in boson: speed. But not because boson is
 * so slow (yes it is - but less than 1 FPS is <em>not</em> boson's fault) but
 * rather because many people out there have a broken installation.
 *
 * After all these broken (or at least strange) installations make it very
 * difficult to help them ("have you installed your diver correctly?" - "yes i
 * have, i am sure" - "can you check that lib foo is in dir bar" - "oops i
 * missed that"). So I decided that I need information about these system for
 * various reasons. One of them are those people above, so that we can give them
 * useful help. It is not enogh that they tell us which library they use - it is
 * important for us to know which they <em>actually</em> use. Another reason is
 * the fact that it makes profiling easier if you know which graphics card,
 * which version, which cpu and so on is involved.
 *
 * Another problem is that we don't want to do certain things on slow computers.
 * So we need access to e.g. the @ref cpuSpeed().
 *
 * KDE provides some nice KControl modules which provide a lot or even most of
 * the data that we need. Unfortunately it is of no use at all in KControl and
 * these data are not provided in a library. So I wrote our own library...
 * We collect data that is/might be useful for us only, so don't expect data
 * about your printer here ;-) But actually if I found some maybe-useful data
 * then I included them here - even if we will probably never actully use them.
 * Rather more than less.
 *
 * You should use @ref BoInfoDialog to inspect the data further. BoInfo provides
 * functions to @ref load and @ref save data into a stream (note: you should ask
 * the user for permission before storing all these data! there is somthing that
 * is called privacy...) and @ref loadFromFile and @ref saveToFile, which are
 * more convenient to use.
 *
 * Getting the data for this class is really easy: call @ref update and you are
 * done. Everything is stored internally from now on and you can access it. Note
 * that @ref update will need a @ref BosonGLWidget, since most X data need at
 * least a widget and OpenGL/GLX wants us to initialize the OpenGL context
 * before we can do anything useful.
 *
 * You can use @ref getBool, @ref getString, ... to get the data, but most
 * entries have their own functions, such as @ref kdeVersion. You should prefer
 * them, since they often do some error checking and so.
