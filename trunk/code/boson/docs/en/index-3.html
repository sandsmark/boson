<H3><A NAME="s3">3. Usage </A></H3>

<P>
<P>In this section, we will explain you the basis to actually be able to play Boson.
The first thing to know is that, because of the lack of any AI player (artificial intelligence),
you won't be able to play alone. You need to have at least another player to play against.

<H3><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Launching Boson</A>
</H3>

<P>When you first launch boson (usually by clicking on the K-menu/Game/Boson), you are
presented with a blank window. 
<P>Every player uses the  <CODE>connect to Server</CODE> item in the <CODE>file</CODE> menu.
<P>One (and only one) of the players have to start a server, the name of the server will then be
the name of its computer.
<P>Other players have to enter the name of the server in the dialog box, and then hit <CODE>connect</CODE>

<H3><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 User interaction </A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>On the keyboard, you may use the arrow keys to move across the map.
<P>The left button of the mouse let you select objects
Left-click on a facility or a mobile unit to select it.
If you left-click on the ground and drag the mouse (while still having the button down), it will draw
a selection rectangle that will select everything in it when you release the button.
<P>When a unit or a facility is selected, the lower bar is as big as is the energy of the selected item. The more
red it is, the less energy it has. When the energy becomes null, the item is destroyed.
<P>The right-button let you do <CODE>actions</CODE> : on the ground it will make a mobile unit to move there,
on a <CODE>friend</CODE> mobile unit, it will follow it, on a <CODE>ennemy</CODE>, it will attack it.
<P>The middle-button is used to move across the map. By middle-clicking on any place, the point you've clicked on
will become the new center of the map. If you click on the center, it will do nothing. If you click on the border, you'll make
a big jump.
