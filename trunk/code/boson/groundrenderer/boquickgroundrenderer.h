/**
 * @short Quick ground renderer.
 *
 * This is the "Quick" ground renderer.
 * It uses VBOs and few other tricks to accelerate the rendering.
 * These "tricks" include:
 * @li Vertices, normals and texture weights are stored in VBOs and thus they
 *  don't have to be calculated and sent to GPU every frame.
 * @li It uses only fog texture to fog the cells, it doesn't "cut out" fogged
 *  cells.
 * @li It divides terrain into chunks and then does culling per-chunk.
 * @li Texture coordinates are not calculated/sent to GPU. Instead, OpenGL's
 *  automatic texture coordinate generation is used.
 *
 * The renderer uses geomipmapping for LOD.
 * LOD choosing algorithm takes chunk's roughness into account, so flat areas
 *  will be optimized more than rough areas.
