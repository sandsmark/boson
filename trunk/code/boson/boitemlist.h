/**
 * This list contains all collision-relevant items of a cell. This is not
 * perfectly true, since aircrafts (which are not collision relevant) are also
 * added to the list, but I hope you get the point. All units of a cell are in
 * the list of the cell, as well as all mines (not the ones where you find
 * minerals but the exploding ones) or other, similar items (maybe rocks or
 * something).
 *
 * Note that since nothing of the above except units is implemented in boson so
 * all items in the list are units, currently.
 *
 * UPDATE: the list now consists of BosonItem and therefore <em>items</em>,
 * not just units. we may add some additional code to separate units (in favor
 * of performance) in the future
 *
 *
 * Note that neither operator=() nor any similar operator has been implemented
 * in this class. Do not use them!
