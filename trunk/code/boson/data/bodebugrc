# this file is pretty similar to the kdebugrc, as installed by kdecore.
# these entries are valid for boson only.
# Below is the description of these entries, as it is found in kdebugrc.
#
# This files includes the default behaviour for some specific debug areas
# This allows to leave the kdDebug* calls in the code, but still have them
# disabled for most users.
#
# This file will be installed as $KDEDIR/share/config/bodebugrc
#
# There are four levels of output: Info, Warn, Error and Fatal
# corresponding to boDebug(), boWarn(), boError(), boFatal()
#
# For every of them you can define a target by *Output=n
# using the following numbers:
#
#   0 = file
#   1 = message box
#   2 = shell (stderr)
#   3 = syslog
#   4 = off
#
# (AB: this will get changed/extended!)
#
# For file output you can give a filename by *Filename=<file>
# otherwise bodebug.dbg in the current directory is used.
#
# ekzample:
#
# For the debug area 100 you want output of debug messages
# to a file /var/log/dbg.log and error messages as message boxes.
# Additionaly the program should abort on fatal errors.
#
# [100]
# InfoOutput=0
# InfoFilename=/var/log/dbg.log
# ErrorOutput=1
# AbortFatal=1
