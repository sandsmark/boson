# changes to am_edit (for boson):
- added sub tag_BOSONDOCFILES() which gets called after tag_DOCFILES().
  we need this to support .wml files for docs.
- added 'BO_DOCS' to the @marks array in tag_DIST(). This is necessary to ensure
  that the .wml files are *not* distributed.
- removed an Error of a sanity check. bounit's .ui files seem to conflict with
  am_edit.
