/**
 * A rotation can be represented in several ways, a quaternion is one of them.
 *
 * The by far easiest and most popular way is to store 3 different rotation
 * values, one for each axis. In OpenGL code this will look like this:
 * <pre>
 * glRotatef(angleX, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
 * glRotatef(angleY, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
 * glRotatef(angleZ, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
 * </pre>
 * These angles are called euler angles.
 * They suffer from the so-called * "gimbal-lock".
 *
 * Use google to find a description on what this "gimbal lock" is  - i am not
 * qualified enough to give a correct description. It is enough to say that the
 * rotation will not occur as you want it to.
 *
 * Another representation is the angle axis representation. Here you do only one
 * rotation, by an arbitrary axis. Code:
 * <pre>
 * glRotatef(angle, axisX, axisY, axisZ);
 * </pre>
 * This does not suffer from gimbal lock but (according to some
 * tutorials/howtos) it suffers from other things, such as when you interpolate
 * between two rotations. This problem does not matter for us, as we do not
 * (yet?) use it. But it is imho hard to use and to calculate.
 *
 * The third, and probably most popular among big 3d projects, way of
 * representing rotations are quaternions.
 *
 * I will not try to explain to you what exactly quaternions are - i am not
 * qualified enough to do this. Use google and e.g.
 * http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1095.asp
 *
 * A quaternion consists of 4 floating point values - a scalar (w) and a vector
 * (v).
 * You can get a rotation matrix (see @ref matrix) from a quaternion and
 * therefore you can easily use it in glMultMatrix.
 *
 * You can convert all major means of rotation into a quaternion,
 * see @ref setRotation.
 *
 * If you @ref multiply a quat by another one you get a similar effect as
 * if you had multiplied both rotation matrices, i.e. the two rotations are
 * combined.
